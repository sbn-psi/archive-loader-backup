The original image size is 537 x 244\n        pixels and the rectified size is 537 x 412 pixels.                    \n        2: x coordinate (kilometers) of the intercept with the surface of the \n        asteroid in body-fixed reference frame                                \n        3: y coordinate (kilometers) of the intercept with the surface of the \n        asteroid in body-fixed reference frame                                \n        4: z coordinate (kilometers) of the intercept with the surface of the \n        asteroid in body-fixed reference frame                                \n        5: latitude (planetocentric, degrees)                                 \n        6: longitude (degrees east)                                           \n        7: radial distance (kilometers) from the asteroid center of figure    \n        8: solar incidence angle (degrees)                                    \n        9: emission angle (degrees)                                           \n        10: solar phase angle (degrees)                                       \n        11: horizontal pixel scale (kilometers)                               \n        12: vertical pixel scale (kilometers)                                 \n        13: average surface slope relative to gravity (degrees)               \n        14: average elevation relative to gravity (meters)                    \n        15: average gravitational acceleration (meters/[s^2])                 \n        16: average gravitational potential (J/kg)",

At half the size of Pluto, Charon is the largest of Pluto's moons and the largest known satellite relative to its parent body. Pluto-Charon is our solar system's only known double planetary system. The same surfaces of Charon and Pluto always face each other, a phenomenon called mutual tidal locking. Charon orbits Pluto every 6.4 Earth days.",

Metis is tidally locked to Jupiter, and its shape is strongly asymmetrical, with one of the diameters being almost twice as large as the smallest one. It is also one of the two moons known to orbit Jupiter in less than the length of Jupiter's day, the other being Adrastea. It orbits within the main ring of Jupiter, and is thought to be a major contributor of material to the rings.",

Adrastea is one of the few moons in the Solar System known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of Jupiter's Main Ring and is thought to be the main contributor of material to the Rings of Jupiter. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the Galileo spacecraft, very little is known about the moon's physical characteristics other than its size and the fact that it is tidally locked to Jupiter.",

Amalthea is in a close orbit around Jupiter and is within the outer edge of the Amalthea Gossamer Ring which is formed from dust ejected from its surface.  Amalthea is the largest of the inner satellites of Jupiter and is irregularly shaped and reddish in color.

Six experiments were carried as part of the science payload: television, ultraviolet spectrometer, infrared spectroscopy, infrared radiometry, S-band occultation and celestial mechanics. Two experiments (S-band occultation and celestial mechanics) utilized the radio telemetry subsystem to derive data; the other required specially developed instruments, mounted, and boresighted to each other, on the spacecraft's scan platform. Pre-launch mission planning encompassed two separate, but complementary, missions. The orbit of each spacecraft was optimized to match the corresponding objective. The mapping mission was designed with an Earth-synchronous orbit (about a 12-hr periods) to maximize antenna utilization, or communications efficiency. For maximum surveillance of an area, it was designed with a steep inclination (80 degrees) to the equatorial plane of Mars. The dynamic objective dictated a Mars-synchronous (or sub-synchronous) orbit and a lower (50 degree) inclination for closer observations of specific areas. The plans for the two missions were in detailed stages of development on May 9, 1971 when Mariner 8 was lost because of guidance difficulties in the second stage of the launch vehicle. It was determined that an orbit for a single-spacecraft mission could be developed to meet all basic mission and specific science objectives. A single-spacecraft plan, involving an inclination of 65 degrees, a period of about 12 hours, a periapsis altitude of 1350 Km, and an arrival date of November 14, 1971, was evaluated and formalized in 2 weeks.",

	"display_description": "The Viking mission to Mars consisted of four spacecraft: the two orbiters VO1 and VO2, and two landers VL1 and VL2. During cruise to Mars, the landers were attached to the orbiters; the combined spacecraft were then known as Viking 1 and 2. The role of the orbiters was to transport the landers to Mars, to carry reconnaissance instruments for certifying the landing sites, to act as relay stations for lander data, and to perform their own scientific investigations. The initial orbit periapses were placed over the candidate landing sites to allow for maximum viewing resolution and relay of the lander data. After the primary lander missions were completed, the orbiters' orbits were allowed to drift so that the entire planetary surface could be systematically mapped by the three remote sensing experiments. The Viking 1 spacecraft was launched August 20, 1975, and arrived at Mars on June 19, 1976. Lander 1 was deployed to the Mars surface on July 20, 1976. The VO1 orbital inclination of 38-39 degrees was chosen to optimize communication with VL1. Viking 2 was launched September 9, 1975 and arrived at Mars August 7, 1976. VL2 landed on September 3, 1976, at a more northerly site than VL1. The VO2 orbit was correspondingly more inclined than VO1; initially 55 degrees, it was later adjusted to 80 degrees, providing particularly good coverage of polar regions. The areocentric locations of VL1 and VL2 have since been determined to be (22.270N, 48.264W) and (47.669N, 226.032W), respectively.",

	"display_description": "Mars Observer was launched September 25, 1992 from Cape Canaveral on a Titan III built by Martin Marietta Corporation, with an upper Transfer Orbit Stage from Orbital Sciences Corporation. On August 21, 1993, flight controllers lost contact with the Mars Observer spacecraft when an expected transmission that was part of the pre-Mars-Orbit-Insertion sequence failed to occur. Subsequent attempts to re-establish communication with the spacecraft proved unsuccessful. After the 11-month transit the spacecraft was to be injected into an elliptical orbit around Mars with periapsis near the north pole. The orbit would then be adjusted through a series of maneuvers to a near-circular, sun-synchronous (2 am/pm), low altitude, near-polar orbit. Due to the non-uniformity of the gravity field, the altitude was to vary from 376 km near the south pole to 430 km near the north pole. During the Martian year in this mapping orbit the instruments were to acquire data in a systematic program of global mapping. At the end of the mission the spacecraft could have been boosted to a permanent quarantine orbit. The Mars orbit insertion (MOI) period was to end one month before solar conjunction and the beginning of the dust storm period. The playback data rate for a 10-hour link would vary by a factor of 4 with Earth-Mars distance during the mission. The continuous data rate to the tape recorders was about one fifth the playback rate for a 10-hour link to a 34 m NASA Deep Space Network tracking station. The normal sequence of collecting scientific data would be to record continuously for 24 hours and then to play the data back in one 10-hour link. The mapping orbit would be a 117-minute orbit with a 7-day repeat cycle. As a result, the planet would be repeatedly mapped in 26-day cycles with a 58.6 km nominal path separation. Orbit trim adjustments would make it possible to obtain uniform coverage during the course of the mission with an ultimate spacing of ground tracks at the equator or 3.1 km. The Mars Observer spacecraft provided a three-axis stabilized, nadir-oriented platform for the continuous observations of Mars by the science instruments. The spacecraft was built by the General Electric Astro-Space Division. The Gamma Ray Spectrometer and Magnetometer sensor assemblies were mounted on individual booms on the spacecraft. All other instruments were rigidly mounted to the spacecraft structure. No movable scan platform was provided; the spacecraft was to be continuously nadir pointed, rotating at the orbital rate. Those instruments that required scanning or multiple fields of view had internal scanning mechanisms.",

Continuing on their more-than-40-year journey since their 1977 launches, they each are much farther away from Earth and the sun than Pluto. In August 2012, Voyager 1 made the historic entry into interstellar space, the region between stars, filled with material ejected by the death of nearby stars millions of years ago. Voyager 2 entered interstellar space on November 5, 2018 and scientists hope to learn more about this region. Both spacecraft are still sending scientific information about their surroundings through the Deep Space Network, or DSN.\n\nThe primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. After making a string of discoveries there — such as active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io and intricacies of Saturn's rings — the mission was extended. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The adventurers' current mission, the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM), will explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain. And beyond.",

During the trip to Mars, instrument health checks were performed and the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument collected science data.  For the primary mission on the surface of Mars (ending September 28, 2014), the rover explored the landing site and gathered imaging, spectroscopy, composition data, and other measurements for selected Martian soils, rocks, and the atmosphere. These data will allow the science team to quantitatively assess the habitability and environmental history.  The prime mission's science objectives were to assess the biological potential of the landing site, characterize the geology of the landing region, investigate planetary processes that influence habitability, and characterize the broad spectrum of surface radiation.  The first extended mission retains all of the prime mission's objectives and will also strive to: identify and quantitatively assess the subset of habitable environments that are also capable of preserving organic compounds, and explore and characterize major environmental transitions recorded in the geology of the foothills of Mt.

During most of the mapping mission, the spacecraft mapped the surface from a 118-minute, circular, polar orbit 100 km above the moon's surface. Starting on December 19, 1998, the spacecraft was maneuvered into a 40 km orbit as a transition into a low altitude extended mission orbit. The transition orbit was used to collect gravity data in order to verify the moon's gravity model in preparation for conducting the extended mission orbit.\n \nThe extended mission began on January 16, 1999. The objective of the extended mission was to provide higher resolution mapping from a circular, polar orbit averaging 30 km above the moon's surface. The Lunar Prospector mission ended on July 31, 1999 when the spacecraft was intentionally impacted into a crater near the south pole. The impact site was targeted for one of the hydrogen deposits detected by Lunar Prospector's Neutron Spectrometer.",

Thrusters and gyros\n    provided physical propulsion and attitude control.\n    Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried\n    out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band\n    frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.\n    A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits\n    when no Earth station was available for real-time data\n    transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of\n    several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation\n    for days or weeks at a time.  More information on the\n    spacecraft can be found in [MORRISON1982], [KOHLHASE1989], and\n    [JPLPD618-128].\n \n    The spacecraft itself was built around its 'bus' -- a decagonal\n    prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm\n    deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a\n    'bay' containing engineering systems or science instrument\n    electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio\n    transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the\n    end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through\n    10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending\n    away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan\n    platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer\n    boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.\n \n \n    Spacecraft Coordinate System\n    ----------------------------\n      The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the\n      spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft\n      coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight\n      defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was\n      also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180\n      degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting\n      the scan platform, extended in the general direction of\n      positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle\n      90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180\n      degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  A boom supporting the RTGs\n      was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.\n      The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate\n      system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed\n      through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction\n      which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.\n      The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle\n      305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).\n \n \n    Telecommunications Subsystem\n    ----------------------------\n      The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,\n      pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic\n      reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted\n      simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and\n      X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna\n      beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.\n      The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure\n      of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the\n      hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.\n \n      The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a\n      redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed\n      functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by\n      swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit\n      science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and\n      115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band\n      link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions\n      sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per\n      second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by\n      the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the\n      Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).\n \n      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink\n      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from\n      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could\n      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the\n      received signal drifted.\n \n \n    Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem\n    -------------------------------------------\n      The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)\n      provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft\n      could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude\n      control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial\n      reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan\n      platform, upon which the four 'remote sensing' instruments\n      were mounted.\n \n      Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory\n      corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to\n      several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with\n      tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less\n      than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less\n      than 0.05 degrees per hour.\n \n      Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a\n      sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright\n      star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,\n      after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When\n      the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount\n      from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters\n      which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The\n      Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium\n      sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and\n      its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star\n      Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,\n      an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of\n      +/-0.05 degrees.\n \n      Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers\n      were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of\n      the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the\n      instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --\n      elevation and azimuth (see below).\n \n \n    Propulsion Subsystem\n    --------------------\n      The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of\n      16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to\n      control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two\n      thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to\n      perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two\n      oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative\n      roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw\n      turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform\n      negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform\n      positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to\n      perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was\n      connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.\n \n \n    Power Subsystem\n    ---------------\n      Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope\n      Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the\n      negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted\n      7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG\n      electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because\n      of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and\n      degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The\n      difference between available electrical power and the power\n      required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the\n      'power margin.' Voyager Project guidelines required a power\n      margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical\n      transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was\n      dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.\n \n \n    Data Storage Subsystem\n    ----------------------\n      The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when\n      real-time communications with Earth were either not possible\n      or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;\n      rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6\n      kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per\n      second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12\n      images or equivalent.\n \n \n    Computer Command Subsystem\n    --------------------------\n      The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two\n      identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and\n      associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central\n      controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager\n      mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used\n      non-redundantly to increase the command and processing\n      capability of the spacecraft.\n \n \n    Flight Data Subsystem\n    ---------------------\n      The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two\n      reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding\n      hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and\n      engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.\n      Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from\n      the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-\n      Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.\n      Data compression was also performed within the FDS.\n \n \n    Science Boom\n    ------------\n      The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma\n      detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged\n      particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the\n      science boom.\n \n \n    Scan Platform\n    -------------\n      Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red\n      Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)\n      were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by\n      motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan\n      platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset\n      (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;\n      the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation\n      (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform\n      azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero\n      azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators\n      were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of\n      each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error\n      of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma\n      per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and\n      Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL has shown larger\n      errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.\n      High rate slews were at 1 deg/sec, medium rate slews were at\n      0.33 deg/sec, and low rate slews were at 0.08 deg/sec.\n \n \n    Magnetometer Boom\n    -----------------\n      Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long\n      boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after\n      Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of\n      the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the\n      end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base\n      of the boom.\n \n \n    Science Sensors\n    ---------------\n      Each Voyager spacecraft carried instrumentation to support\n      eleven science investigations.  Target body (or remote\n      sensing) instruments included:\n \n      (1) Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)\n      (2) Photopolarimeter Subsystem (PPS)\n      (3) Infrared Radiometer Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS)\n      (4) Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)\n \n      Fields, waves, and particles (or in situ) sensors included:\n \n      (1) Plasma Subsystem (PLS)\n      (2) Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP)\n      (3) Cosmic-Ray Subsystem (CRS)\n      (4) Magnetic Fields (MAG)\n      (5) Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS)\n      (6) Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA)\n \n      The Radio Science (RSS) investigation was carried out using\n      the on-board and ground elements of the Telecommunications\n      Subsystem (TCS).  More information on instrumentation for\n      each of the science investigations can be found elsewhere.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    Voyager Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation\n    with elements on both the spacecraft and at ground stations of\n    the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this was shared\n    equipment, used for routine telecommunications as well as for\n    Radio Science.\n \n    The DSN is a telecommunications facility managed by the Jet\n    Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology\n    for NASA.  The primary function of the DSN is to provide\n    two-way communications between the Earth and spacecraft\n    exploring the solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN\n    is equipped with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers\n    and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n    During the Voyager era the DSN consisted of three complexes\n    situated at approximately equally spaced longitudinal intervals\n    around the globe at Goldstone (near Barstow, California),\n    Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra,\n    Australia).  Two of the complexes are located in the northern\n    hemisphere while the third is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n    The network comprised several subnets, each of which included\n    one antenna at each complex.  The subnets were defined\n    according to the properties of their respective antennas.  Over\n    the course of the Voyager Mission, those antennas were expanded\n    and improved.  Nominal dimensions at the end (and beginning) of\n    the Voyager Mission were: 70-m diameter (initially 64-m),\n    standard 34-m diameter (initially 26-m), and high-efficiency\n    34-m diameter (did not exist at beginning of Voyager).\n \n    Additional ground equipment was provided by the Commonwealth\n    Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in\n    Australia, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science\n    (ISAS) in Japan, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory\n    (NRAO) in the United States.  For the Voyager 2 encounters with\n    Uranus and Neptune, the CSIRO 64-m diameter radio astronomy\n    antenna near Parkes (Australia) was included in the receiving\n    system for both telemetry and Radio Science.  For the Voyager 2\n    encounter with Neptune, the ISAS 64-m diameter antenna near\n    Usuda (Japan) was added for Radio Science and the NRAO Very\n    Large Array (VLA) near Socorro (New Mexico) was added for\n    telemetry.  The VLA consisted of 27 25-m antennas.  Parkes,\n    Usuda, and the VLA were integrated with the permanent stations\n    at Goldstone, Robledo, and Tidbinbilla by DSN personnel.\n \n \n  Acronyms and Abbreviations\n  ==========================\n    AACS       Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem\n    CCS        Computer Command Subsystem\n    CDU        Command Detector Unit\n    CRS        Cosmic Ray (investigation) Subsystem\n    CSIRO      Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research\n               Organization\n    DSN        Deep Space Network\n    DTR        Digital Tape Recorder\n    FDS        Flight Data Subsystem\n    HGA        High-Gain Antenna\n    IRIS       Infra-Red Interferometric Spectrometer\n    ISAS       Institute for Space and Astronautical Science\n    ISS        Imaging Science Subsystem\n    JPL        Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n    kbps       kilobits per second\n    LECP       Low-Energy Charged Particle (investigation subsystem)\n    LGA        Low-Gain Antenna\n    MAG        Magnetometer (subsystem)\n    NAIF       Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility\n    NASA       National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n    NRAO       National Radio Astronomy Observatory\n    PLS        Plasma (science investigation) Subsystem\n    PPS        PhotoPolarimeter Subsystem\n    PRA        Planetary Radio Astronomy (investigation subsystem)\n    PWS        Plasma Wave (investigation) Subsystem\n    RSS        Radio Science Subsystem\n    RTG        Radioisotopic Thermoelectric Generator\n    TCS        TeleCommunications Subsystem\n    UVS        Ultra-Violet Spectrometer\n    VLA        Very Large Array",

Those data were then relayed\n    via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space\n    Network (DSN) on Earth.  Radio Science experiments (such as\n    radio occultations) required that DSN hardware also participate\n    in data acquisition.  The following sections provide an\n    overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground\n    system as both supported Voyager science activities.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n  =====================================\n    The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft were identical and were\n    built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

Extending\n    away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan\n    platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer\n    boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.\n \n \n    Spacecraft Coordinate System\n    ----------------------------\n      The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the\n      spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft\n      coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight\n      defining the negative z-direction.

The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction\n      which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.\n      The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle\n      305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).\n \n \n    Telecommunications Subsystem\n    ----------------------------\n      The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,\n      pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic\n      reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted\n      simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and\n      X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna\n      beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.\n      The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure\n      of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the\n      hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.\n \n      The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a\n      redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed\n      functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by\n      swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit\n      science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and\n      115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band\n      link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions\n      sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per\n      second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by\n      the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the\n      Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).\n \n      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink\n      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from\n      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could\n      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the\n      received signal drifted.  Unfortunately, a series of failures\n      in the Voyager 2 receivers left that transponder unable to\n      track the uplink signal.  Beginning in April 1978, Doppler\n      shifts were predicted and the uplink carrier was tuned so\n      that Voyager 2 would see what appeared to be a signal at\n      constant frequency (to an accuracy of 100 Hz).\n \n \n    Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem\n    -------------------------------------------\n      The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)\n      provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft\n      could maintain a fixed orientation in space.

Two\n      oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative\n      roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw\n      turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform\n      negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform\n      positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to\n      perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was\n      connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.\n \n \n    Power Subsystem\n    ---------------\n      Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope\n      Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the\n      negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted\n      7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG\n      electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because\n      of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and\n      degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The\n      difference between available electrical power and the power\n      required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the\n      'power margin.' Voyager Project guidelines required a power\n      margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical\n      transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was\n      dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.\n \n \n    Data Storage Subsystem\n    ----------------------\n      The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when\n      real-time communications with Earth were either not possible\n      or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;\n      rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6\n      kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per\n      second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12\n      images or equivalent.\n \n \n    Computer Command Subsystem\n    --------------------------\n      The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two\n      identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and\n      associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central\n      controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager\n      mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used\n      non-redundantly to increase the command and processing\n      capability of the spacecraft.\n \n \n    Flight Data Subsystem\n    ---------------------\n      The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two\n      reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding\n      hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and\n      engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.\n      Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from\n      the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-\n      Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.\n      Data compression was also performed within the FDS.\n \n \n    Science Boom\n    ------------\n      The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma\n      detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged\n      particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the\n      science boom.\n \n \n    Scan Platform\n    -------------\n      Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red\n      Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)\n      were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by\n      motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan\n      platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset\n      (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;\n      the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation\n      (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform\n      azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero\n      azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators\n      were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of\n      each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error\n      of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma\n      per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and\n      Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL has shown larger\n      errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.\n      High rate slews of 1 deg/sec were discontinued after the\n      azimuth drive mechanism on Voyager 2 temporarily froze a\n      short time after Saturn closest approach.  The medium slew\n      rate was 0.33 deg/sec, and the low slew rate was 0.08\n      deg/sec.\n \n \n    Magnetometer Boom\n    -----------------\n      Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long\n      boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after\n      Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of\n      the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the\n      end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base\n      of the boom.\n \n \n    Science Sensors\n    ---------------\n      Each Voyager spacecraft carried instrumentation to support\n      eleven science investigations.  Target body (or remote\n      sensing) instruments included:\n \n      (1) Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)\n      (2) Photopolarimeter Subsystem (PPS)\n      (3) Infrared Radiometer Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS)\n      (4) Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)\n \n      Fields, waves, and particles (or in situ) sensors included:\n \n      (1) Plasma Subsystem (PLS)\n      (2) Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP)\n      (3) Cosmic-Ray Subsystem (CRS)\n      (4) Magnetic Fields (MAG)\n      (5) Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS)\n      (6) Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA)\n \n      The Radio Science (RSS) investigation was carried out using\n      the on-board and ground elements of the Telecommunications\n      Subsystem (TCS).  More information on instrumentation for\n      each of the science investigations can be found elsewhere.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    Voyager Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation\n    with elements on both the spacecraft and at ground stations of\n    the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this was shared\n    equipment, used for routine telecommunications as well as for\n    Radio Science.\n \n    The DSN is a telecommunications facility managed by the Jet\n    Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology\n    for NASA.  The primary function of the DSN is to provide\n    two-way communications between the Earth and spacecraft\n    exploring the solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN\n    is equipped with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers\n    and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n    During the Voyager era the DSN consisted of three complexes\n    situated at approximately equally spaced longitudinal intervals\n    around the globe at Goldstone (near Barstow, California),\n    Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra,\n    Australia).  Two of the complexes are located in the northern\n    hemisphere while the third is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n    The network comprised several subnets, each of which included\n    one antenna at each complex.  The subnets were defined\n    according to the properties of their respective antennas.  Over\n    the course of the Voyager Mission, those antennas were expanded\n    and improved.  Nominal dimensions at the end (and beginning) of\n    the Voyager Mission were: 70-m diameter (initially 64-m),\n    standard 34-m diameter (initially 26-m), and high-efficiency\n    34-m diameter (did not exist at beginning of Voyager).\n \n    Additional ground equipment was provided by the Commonwealth\n    Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in\n    Australia, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science\n    (ISAS) in Japan, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory\n    (NRAO) in the United States.  For the Voyager 2 encounters with\n    Uranus and Neptune, the CSIRO 64-m diameter radio astronomy\n    antenna near Parkes (Australia) was included in the receiving\n    system for both telemetry and Radio Science.  For the Voyager 2\n    encounter with Neptune, the ISAS 64-m diameter antenna near\n    Usuda (Japan) was added for Radio Science and the NRAO Very\n    Large Array (VLA) near Socorro (New Mexico) was added for\n    telemetry.  The VLA consisted of 27 25-m antennas.  Parkes,\n    Usuda, and the VLA were integrated with the permanent stations\n    at Goldstone, Robledo, and Tidbinbilla by DSN personnel.\n \n \n  Acronyms and Abbreviations\n  ==========================\n    AACS       Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem\n    CCS        Computer Command Subsystem\n    CDU        Command Detector Unit\n    CRS        Cosmic Ray (investigation) Subsystem\n    CSIRO      Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research\n               Organization\n    DSN        Deep Space Network\n    DTR        Digital Tape Recorder\n    FDS        Flight Data Subsystem\n    HGA        High-Gain Antenna\n    IRIS       Infra-Red Interferometric Spectrometer\n    ISAS       Institute for Space and Astronautical Science\n    ISS        Imaging Science Subsystem\n    JPL        Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n    kbps       kilobits per second\n    LECP       Low-Energy Charged Particle (investigation subsystem)\n    LGA        Low-Gain Antenna\n    MAG        Magnetometer (subsystem)\n    NAIF       Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility\n    NASA       National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n    NRAO       National Radio Astronomy Observatory\n    PLS        Plasma (science investigation) Subsystem\n    PPS        PhotoPolarimeter Subsystem\n    PRA        Planetary Radio Astronomy (investigation subsystem)\n    PWS        Plasma Wave (investigation) Subsystem\n    RSS        Radio Science Subsystem\n    RTG        Radioisotopic Thermoelectric Generator\n    TCS        TeleCommunications Subsystem\n    UVS        Ultra-Violet Spectrometer\n    VLA        Very Large Array",

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    For most Phoenix Mars Scout Lander experiments, data was collected by\n    instruments on the  spacecraft. Those data were then relayed directly\n    to stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN)  on Earth or\n    indirectly using the Mars orbiters Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) or 2001\n    Mars Odyssey  (ODY). The following sections provide an overview first\n    of the Phoenix spacecraft, then of the DSN  ground system, and finally\n    of the 2001 Mars Odyssey, as each supported Phoenix science\n    activities.\n \n  Instrument Host Description\n  ===========================\n \n    The Mars Phoenix Lander was build for the canceled Mars 2000 Lander\n    Mission. The spacecraft  was refurbished and held as the instrument\n    host for the Phoenix mission [SMITHETAL2008]. Phoenix  was the first\n    of the Scout class mission and consisted of a single lander with\n    associated  instrumentation. The Lander was about 18 feet (5.5 meters)\n    long with the solar panels deployed, and  the science deck by itself\n    was about 5 feet (1.5 meters) in diameter. From the ground to the top\n    of the  MET mast, the Lander measured about 7 feet (2.2 meters) tall.\n    The Lander weighed 350 kg, or 770 lbs.  It was launched on August 4,\n    2007, on a Delta II 7925 launch vehicle, and was operational until\n    November 2, 2008, performing on the Martian surface for 152 sols.\n \n    Power was generated during the cruise stage by two gallium arsenide\n    solar panels (total area  3.1 m2, or 33 ft2) mounted to the cruise\n    stage. After touchdown, Phoenix relied on two octagonal  gallium\n    arsenide solar panel wings extending from the Lander base to charge\n    its battery for operations.  Input from the solar panels was\n    sufficient to power daytime operations, but nighttime operations\n    required additional power from the Lander heater system.\n \n    Phoenix communicated directly with Earth using the X-band portion of\n    the radio spectrum (8  to 12 gigahertz) throughout the launch and\n    cruise stages. Continuous and instantaneous  communication with the\n    spacecraft was maintained throughout the launch phase, switching to\n    communication every three days in the cruise phase.  All X-band\n    capability was lost once the cruise  stage was jettisoned. During the\n    surface mission, the landed Helix antenna on the Lander deck\n    communicated with DSN via the orbiters Mars Express (MRO), Mars\n    Odyssey (ODY), and Mars Express  (MEX) every four to eight hours.\n \n    Other Lander systems included a single RAD6000 processor, a fault\n    detection and correction  system for monitoring spacecraft health, a\n    guidance system to land the spacecraft, a propulsion  system for\n    touchdown, a data handling system for committing critical data to\n    overnight storage during  surface operations, and a heater system to\n    ensure the spacecraft maintained an appropriate  temperature . The\n    Lander served as a host for various associated instrumentation,\n    including six  instrument packages: the Surface Stereo Imager (SSI),\n    Robotic Arm (RA) and associated Icy Soil  Acquisition Device (ISAD),\n    the Robotic Arm Camera (RAC), the Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and\n    Conductivity Analyzer (MECA), the Thermal Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA),\n    and the Meteorological  Package (MET) [SMITHETAL2008].\n \n    During most of Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), Phoenix used a UHF\n    antenna that wrapped around  the backshell to give it a wide field of\n    view (FOV) for  communications. During terminal descent (approximately\n    30 seconds before landing), the Lander switched to the landed Helix\n    antenna  and continued transmitting a UHF signal until one minute\n    after  landing. This wide FOV was  necessary as the geometry between\n    Phoenix and the orbiters MRO, ODY, and MEX  required a very wide\n    spread of off-boresight angles.\n \n    Following its soft touchdown between 65 deg N to 72 deg N latitude,\n    and after waiting 20 minutes for the dust to settle, the Lander\n    performed a number of critical activities. These 'Sol 0' (a sol is  a\n    mars day) activities included deployments of the landed solar  arrays,\n    the bio-barrier covering the RA, and the SSI and MET  masts. The SSI\n    took images of the bio-barrier, solar arrays,  and part of the footpad\n    and workspace. High priority EDL and Sol  0 data were saved to flash\n    memory within the first hour after  touchdown, after which the Lander\n    went to sleep to conserve  energy. The Lander woke up for 10 minutes\n    for the first  post-landed UHF communication pass one ODY or MRO orbit\n    period  (approximately 2 hours) after landing. After relaying data to\n    the orbiters during that first pass, the  Lander went to sleep again.\n    Payload heaters were on  continuously from touchdown, with Lander\n    heaters kicking in  around midnight for 4-5 hours of keep-alive\n    heating.  [GUINNETAL2008]\n \n  Lander on the Surface of Mars\n  =============================\n    The first seven sols after Landing were known as the  characterization\n    phase, with pre-planned activities running from  a minimum of 3 hours\n    on Sol 1 to a maximum of 6.5 hours on Sol 6  (the Lander was active\n    for up to 7 hours during the nominal surface  or digging phase). The\n    performance of the spacecraft's power, thermal, and UHF subsystems\n    were thoroughly characterized during  this phase, and TEGA, MECA, and\n    MET instruments went through their initial checkouts and  prepared for\n    nominal operations. Concurrent with  these activities, the EDL and Sol\n    0 data that were stored in the  non-volatile (flash memory) were\n    relayed to the ground. The SSI  imaged as much of the Lander as it\n    could see and characterized  the workspace and surrounding\n    environment. The  RAC located on the 'wrist' of the RA was  used to\n    image the footpads and the TEGA cover, as it was the only  imager that\n    could be maneuvered into the proper viewpoint for these  pictures.\n \n    After the Robotic Arm (RA) was checked out, the digging phase\n    commenced. The digging phase activities included digging a trench  in\n    front of the Lander, and the analysis of soil samples at  various\n    trench-depths by the Lander instruments. This phase  continued until\n    the End-of-Mission on Sol 90. Operations during  this phase were\n    conducted at the University of Arizona.\n \n    The Lander operated for 152 sols and achieved all scientific\n    objectives.\n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n    by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n    Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n    Administration (NASA).\n \n    The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n    communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n    solar system.  To carry out this function it is equipped with\n    high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,\n    and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n    The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n    equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at\n    Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,\n    Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of\n    the complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the\n    third is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n    Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their\n    diameters, construction, or operational characteristics:\n    70-m diameter, standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m\n    diameter (HEF), and 34-m beam waveguide (BWG).\n \n    For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].\n \n  Instrument Host Overview - 2001 Mars Odyssey\n  ============================================\n    The 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY) spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin\n    Astronautics (LMA).  Most spacecraft systems were redundant\n    in order to provide backup should a device fail.  In addition\n    to transmitting data collected by ODY instruments and systems,\n    the telecommunications system was used to relay data from Mars\n    surface assets and measure their relative motion radiometrically\n    in the 400 MHz frequency range.

Both spacecraft operated from 1976 through\n      April 1980 and Viking Lander 1 (VL1) continued to operate until\n      November 1982.  In 1981, Viking Lander 1 was renamed the Thomas\n      A.  Mutch Memorial Station in honor of Tim Mutch, Lander\n      Imaging Team Leader and later NASA Associate Administrator for\n      Space Sciences.  Tim Mutch was killed in a climbing accident in\n      1980.\n \n      The Viking Landers were identical to each other and had the\n      same instrument packages.  The main lander structure was a\n      hexagonal prism body that housed the spacecraft computers, tape\n      recorder, batteries, several science instruments, and controls\n      for the surface sampler, thermal system, and data handling\n      system.  The spacecraft body was supported above the surface by\n      three legs, each with a curved footpad.

	"display_description": "Mars Observer was launched September 25, 1992 from Cape Canaveral\n    on a Titan III built by Martin Marietta Corporation, with an\n    upper Transfer Orbit Stage from Orbital Sciences Corporation.\n    Flight controllers lost contact with the spacecraft on August\n    21, 1993, effectively terminating the mission.\n \n    For most Mars Observer experiments, data were to be collected by\n    instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then to be\n    relayed via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep\n    Space Network (DSN) on the ground.  Radio Science experiments\n    (such as radio tracking of the spacecraft and bistatic radio\n    scattering experiments) required that DSN hardware also\n    participate in data acquisition.  The following sections provide\n    an overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground\n    system as both supported Mars Observer science activities.\n \n    Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n    =====================================\n \n      The Mars Observer spacecraft provided a stabilized,\n      nadir-oriented platform for continuous observations of Mars by\n      an advanced set of science instruments.However, communication\n      with the spacecraft was lost three days before it was scheduled\n      to enter Mars orbit in late August 1993.  Only data from\n      Earth-Mars cruise and a very small amount of distant-encounter\n      Mars data were obtained from Mars Observer.\n \n      The spacecraft contract was originally won by the RCA\n      Astro-Space Division (ASD), which subsequently became the\n      General Electric Astro-Space Division when the two companies\n      merged.  The selection of RCA was intended to make maximum use\n      of existing designs and technologies from DMSP/TIROS weather\n      satellites and Satcom-K communication satellites.  General\n      Electric sold ASD to Martin Marietta Corporation at about the\n      time Mars Observer was launched; Martin Marietta was the prime\n      contractor when the spacecraft was lost.\n \n      The dimensions of the rectangular bus were 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.1 m in\n      the x-y-z dimensions.  When fully deployed, the six-panel solar\n      array was 7.0 x 3.7 meters, and would have developed over a\n      kilowatt of power at Mars.  The mass of the spacecraft was\n      about 1028 kg, including 166 kg of payload but excluding the\n      approximately 1346 kg of propellant required, most of which was\n      intended for orbit insertion and orbit circularization at Mars.\n      The propellant also included 63 kg of hydrazine, which would\n      have been used for spacecraft control during mapping.\n \n      At launch (25 September 1992), the solar panels and high-gain\n      antenna were folded against the rectangular bus and the two\n      science booms (Magnetometer and Gamma-Ray Spectrometer) were\n      retracted.  During early cruise the partially-deployed\n      spacecraft was stabilized in a controlled 0.01-rpm roll about\n      the y-axis; communications were conducted with Earth via a\n      low-gain antenna.  For trajectory correction and orbit\n      insertion maneuvers the spacecraft was oriented under three-\n      axis control and then returned to cruise attitude.\n \n      In its mapping orbit, Mars Observer was to be controlled in\n      three axes, using its horizon sensors to point the science\n      instruments on the +Z face toward the nadir.  The six-panel\n      solar-array was to be fully deployed on a boom to track the Sun\n      during each orbit, and the high-gain antenna boom was to be\n      fully deployed to track the Earth around each orbit.\n \n      Spacecraft pointing control was provided by four reaction\n      wheels.  Attitude information during mapping was to be provided\n      by a Mars horizon sensor that defined the nadir direction, a\n      star-mapper for inertial attitude, gyros and accelerometers for\n      measuring angular rates and linear accelerations, and multiple\n      sun sensors.  The spacecraft was required to maintain adequate\n      pointing control and to provide sufficient telemetry to allow\n      reconstruction of the pointing after each orbit.  The telemetry\n      stream provided data from the sensors sufficient to\n      characterize nadir and high-gain antenna pointing to within +/-\n      3 mrad (per axis, 3 sigma) and boom-mounted science instrument\n      pointing to within +/- 25 mrad (per axis, 3 sigma).\n \n      Two independent propulsion systems were provided.  All major\n      maneuvers, both in cruise and during orbit insertion, were to\n      be accomplished by a hypergolic, bipropellant system.  A\n      hydrazine system was available for orbit trim maneuvers during\n      the mapping period and some attitude control functions,\n      including unloading of the momentum wheels.  The hydrazine\n      thrusters were chosen to minimize contamination of the\n      instruments during the mapping period.\n \n      Most instruments were rigidly mounted on a nadir-pointing\n      spacecraft panel and, in general, provided simultaneous views\n      of the same nadir area.  No movable scan platform was provided;\n      the spacecraft was to be continuously pointed toward nadir,\n      rotating at the orbital rate.  Those instruments that required\n      scanning or multiple fields of view were constructed with\n      internal scanning mechanisms.  The Gamma Ray Spectrometer and\n      Magnetometer sensor assemblies were mounted on individual booms\n      on the spacecraft.  The steerable high-gain antenna (used for\n      radio science) was mounted on a third boom.\n \n      For more information regarding the Mars Observer spacecraft,\n      see [ALBEE&PALLUCONI1990]\n \n \n    Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n    ==============================\n      The Mars Observer Radio Science investigations utilized\n      instrumentation with elements both on the spacecraft and at the\n      NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this is shared\n      equipment, being used for routine telecommunications as well as\n      for Radio Science.\n \n      The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n      by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n      Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n      Administration.\n \n      The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n      communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n      solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN is equipped\n      with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and\n      receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n      The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n      equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at\n      Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,\n      Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the\n      complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the\n      third is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n      The network comprises four subnets, each of which includes one\n      antenna at each complex.  The four subnets are defined\n      according to the properties of their respective antennas: 70-m\n      diameter, standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m\n      diameter, and 26-m diameter.\n \n      These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications\n      subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft, constitute the major\n      elements of instrumentation for radio science investigations.\n \n      For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].",

Those data were then relayed\n      via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space\n      Network (DSN) on the ground.  Radio Science experiments (such\n      as radio occultations) required that DSN hardware also\n      participate in data acquisition.  The following sections\n      provide an overview first of the spacecraft and then of the\n      DSN ground system as both supported Mars Global Surveyor\n      science activities.\n \n \n    Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n    =====================================\n      The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft was built by\n      Lockheed Martin Astronautics (LMA).  The spacecraft structure\n      included four subassemblies: the equipment module, the\n      propulsion module, the solar array support structure, and the\n      high-gain antenna (HGA) support structure.\n \n      The equipment module housed the avionics packages and science\n      instruments.  Its dimensions were 1.221 x 1.221 x 0.762 meters\n      in X, Y, and Z, respectively.  With the exception of the\n      Magnetometer, all of the science instruments were bolted to\n      the nadir equipment deck, mounted above the equipment module on\n      the +Z panel.  The Mars Relay antenna was the tallest\n      instrument rising 1.115 meters above the nadir equipment deck.\n \n      Inside, two identical computers orchestrated almost all of\n      the spacecraft's flight activities.  Although only one of the\n      two units controlled Surveyor at any one time, identical\n      software ran concurrently in the backup unit in case of an\n      emergency.  Each computer consisted of a Marconi 1750A\n      microprocessor, 128 Kbytes of RAM for storage, and 20 Kbytes\n      of ROM that contained code to run basic survival routines in\n      the event that the computers experienced a reset.\n \n      Additional storage for science and spacecraft health data\n      was provided by two solid-state recorders with a combined\n      capacity of 375 megabytes.  Mars Global Surveyor was NASA's\n      first planetary spacecraft to use RAM exclusively (instead of\n      a tape recorder) for mass data storage.  This technological\n      improvement reduced operational complexity and cost.\n \n      The equipment module also housed three 'reaction wheels'\n      mounted at right angles to each other.  By transferring angular\n      momentum to and from the rapidly spinning reaction wheels, MGS\n      flight computers could control the spacecraft attitude to high\n      precision.  A fourth reaction wheel, mounted in a direction\n      skewed to the other three, provided redundancy and backup.\n \n      Sun sensors were placed at several locations about the\n      spacecraft.  They provided basic information on spacecraft\n      attitude -- namely, a rough vector toward the Sun.  Their\n      primary use was during attitude reinitialization after a\n      spacecraft anomaly.\n \n      The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) contained gyroscopes\n      and accelerometers to measure angular rates and linear\n      accelerations.  Angular rate measurements were used to\n      determine yaw attitude during the Mapping Phase.  The IMU\n      also provided inertial attitude control, as might be\n      required during maneuvers.\n \n      The Mars Horizon Sensor Assembly (MHSA) determined the horizon\n      as seen from the spacecraft; from this, an empirical nadir\n      could be derived for pointing the science instruments.  The\n      MHSA was mounted to the +Z panel of the equipment module, next\n      to the science instruments.\n \n      The Celestial Sensor Assembly (CSA) complemented the IMU by\n      providing attitude data based on determination of positions\n      of known stars.  It was used during the Cruise Phase and Orbit\n      Insertion Phase for both attitude determination and control.\n      It was also used when precise attitude knowledge was required\n      during the Mapping Phase.  The CSA was mounted to the +Z panel\n      of the equipment module, next to the science instruments.\n \n      The propulsion module contained the propellant tanks, main\n      engines, propulsion feed system and attitude control\n      thrusters.  It was a rectangular box 1.063 meters on a side\n      and was bolted to the equipment module on the latter's -Z\n      panel.  The propulsion module also served as the adaptor to\n      the launch vehicle.\n \n      Propulsion was provided by a dual mode bi-propellant system\n      using nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and hydrazine.  This dual mode\n      differed from conventional bi-propellant systems in that the\n      hydrazine was used by both the main engine and the attitude\n      control thrusters, rather than having separate hydrazine\n      tanks for each.  The main engine was the only one that used\n      the bi-propellant system.  The main engine maximum thrust\n      was 659 N.  It was used for major maneuvers including large\n      trajectory corrections during Cruise, Mars orbit injection\n      (MOI), and transfer to the Mapping orbit (TMO).\n \n      Four rocket engine modules (REM), each containing three 4.45 N\n      thrusters, were provided.  Each REM contained two aft-facing\n      thrusters and one roll control thruster.  Four of the eight\n      aft-facing thrusters were used for the smaller trajectory\n      corrections during Cruise and for Orbit Trim Maneuvers (OTM)\n      during Mapping; they could also be used for attitude control\n      during main engine burns.  Two sets of four thrusters were on\n      redundant strings so that one string could be isolated in the\n      event of a failure.  Four thrusters were provided for\n      attitude control.  In addition to their role during maneuvers,\n      the 4.45 N thrusters were also used for momentum management.\n \n      MGS carried about 385 kg of propellant; nearly 75 percent of\n      that was used during MOI.\n \n      Two solar arrays, each 3.53 meters long by 1.85 meters wide\n      provided power.  Each array was mounted close to the top of\n      the propulsion module on the +Y and -Y panels and near the\n      interface between the propulsion and equipment modules.\n      Including the adaptor that held the array to the propulsion\n      module, the tip of each array was designed to stand 4.270\n      meters from the side of the spacecraft.  During initial\n      deployment, the -Y solar array yoke was damaged leaving its\n      exact position and orientation in some doubt (and leading to\n      several changes in mission design).  Rectangular, metal\n      'drag flaps' were mounted to the end of each array; these\n      flaps increased the total surface area of the structure and\n      added another 0.813 meters to the overall dimensions.\n      Between each array and flap was mounted a magnetometer sensor.\n \n      Each array consisted of two panels, an inner and outer panel,\n      comprised of gallium arsenide and silicon solar cells,\n      respectively.  During mapping operations at Mars, the amount\n      of power produced by the arrays varied from a high of 980\n      Watts at perihelion to a low of 660 Watts at aphelion.\n \n      While in orbit around Mars, the solar arrays provided\n      power as MGS flew over the day side of the planet.  When\n      the spacecraft passed over the night side, energy flowed\n      from two nickel-hydrogen (NiH2) batteries, each with a\n      capacity of about 20 Amp-hours.  Eclipses lasted from 36 to\n      41 minutes per orbit; depth of battery discharge was limited\n      to 27% except during emergencies.\n \n      The high-gain antenna structure was also bolted to the\n      outside of the propulsion module.  When fully deployed, the\n      1.5-meter diameter antenna sat at the end of a 2-meter boom\n      which was mounted to the +X panel of the propulsion module.\n      Two rotating joints (gimbals) held the antenna to the boom\n      and allowed the antenna to track and point at Earth while\n      the science instruments observed Mars.\n \n      One of the two main functions of the HGA was to receive\n      command sequences sent by the flight operations\n      team on Earth.  During command periods, data flowed to MGS\n      at rates in multiples of two from 7.8125 bits per second\n      (emergency rate) to 500 bits per second (750 commands per\n      minute); the nominal rate was 125 bits per second.\n \n      The other main function of the HGA was to send data back\n      to Earth.  All transmissions from MGS utilized an X-band\n      radio link near 8.4 gigahertz.  The transmitted power was\n      about 25 watts.  Data rates as high as 85333 bits per second\n      were used.\n \n      The spacecraft was also equipped with four low-gain antennas\n      (LGA), two for transmit and two for receive.  The LGAs were\n      used in Inner Cruise, during special events such as maneuvers,\n      during aerobraking, and for emergency communications following\n      a spacecraft anomaly.\n \n      The primary transmitting low-gain antenna (LGT1) was mounted\n      on the traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) enclosure, which\n      was mounted on the rim of the HGA reflector; its boresight\n      was aligned with the HGA boresight, which was in the +X\n      direction until HGA deployment.  The backup (LGT2) was also\n      mounted on the TWTA enclosure.  LGT2 boresight was aligned\n      at a cant angle approximately 160 degrees away from the\n      shared boresights of the HGA and LGT1.  This angle was chosen\n      to minimize the consequences of a gimbal failure once\n      articulation commenced after deployment of the HGA boom in\n      mapping orbit.  LGT2 was not used prior to HGA deployment\n      because its orientation and proximity to the nadir payload\n      deck would lead to irradiation of the payload instruments\n      while the HGA was in its stowed position.  One receiving LGA\n      (LGR) was mounted on the -X panel of the equipment module;\n      the other was on the +X side of the propulsion module.\n \n      The spacecraft was equipped with an experimental Ka-band\n      downlink radio system.  The transmitter converted the X-band\n      signal to 32 Ghz and amplified it to about 0.5 watts; the\n      Ka-band output was radiated through the HGA.\n \n      The spacecraft +Z axis vector was normal to the nadir equipment\n      deck; the main engine was aimed in the -Z direction.  The -X\n      axis vector was in the direction of the velocity vector during\n      nominal Mapping (e.g., May 1999).  +X was in the direction of\n      the HGA boresight during Cruise, and the HGA boom was mounted to\n      the +X panel of the propulsion module.  The +Y axis completed an\n      orthogonal rectangular coordinate system.  The +/-Y axes defined\n      generally the deployment directions of the solar panels.  The\n      solar cells themselves were on the -Z sides of the panels.\n \n      There were three levels of anomaly response in the spacecraft\n      flight software.  The first, emergency mode, was entered in\n      response to a command-loss timeout.  Entry into emergency mode\n      reconfigured the telecom subsystem to its lowest data rate\n      settings to enhance the chances of successful contact from\n      Earth.  After a programmable period of time in emergency mode,\n      the spacecraft transitioneds to contingency mode.\n \n      Contingency mode was entered by four paths: failure to regain\n      contact with Earth while in emergency mode, power-related faults\n      such as gimbal faults and low battery state of charge, loss of\n      inertial reference, and explicit ground command.  Contingency\n      mode sets telecom rates to their minimum values, turneds off\n      non-essential power loads (including the payload), disableds\n      stored sequences not explicitly specified as enabled for this\n      mode, and changeds the spacecraft attitude to sun-coning to\n      optimize power and communications.\n \n      Safe mode was the deepest level of anomaly response.  It couldan be\n      be entered by three paths: failures of key spacecraft components\n      that could cannot be corrected by normal fault protection, power-on\n      reset of both Spacecraft Control Processors (SCPs), or explicit\n      ground command.  The response to safe mode entry was similar to\n      that of contingency mode.  Safe mode program code for the SCP was\n      executed from Programmable Read-Only-Memory (PROM).\n \n      For more information on the spacecraft and mission see\n      [JPLD-12088].\n \n \n    Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n    ==============================\n      The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n      by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n      Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n      Administration (NASA).\n \n      The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n      communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n      solar system.  To carry out this function it is equipped with\n      high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,\n      and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n      The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n      equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at\n      Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,\n      Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n  =====================================\n \n    Launch Vehicle Description\n    --------------------------\n      The launch vehicle used for Mars Pathfinder was the McDonnell\n      Douglas Delta II 7925.  An engine section in the Delta first\n      stage housed the Rocketdyne RS-27 main engine and two\n      Rocketdyne LR101-NA-11 vernier engines.  The vernier engines\n      provided roll control during main engine burn, and attitude\n      control after main engine cutoff and before second stage\n      separation.  The RS-27 main engine was a single start, liquid\n      bi-propellant rocket engine which provided approximately\n      894,094 N of thrust at lift off.  The first stage propellant\n      load (96,000 kg) consisted of RP-1 fuel (thermally stable\n      kerosene) and liquid oxygen as an oxidizer.  The RP-1 fuel tank\n      and liquid oxygen tank were separated by a center body section\n      that housed control electronics, ordnance sequencing equipment,\n      a telemetry system, and a rate gyro.  First stage thrust\n      augmentation was provided by nine solid-propellant Graphite\n      Epoxy Motors (GEMs), each fueled with 12,000 kg of\n      hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene solid propellant.  Each GEM\n      provided an average thrust of 439,796 N at lift off.  The main\n      engine, vernier engines, and six of the GEMs were ignited at\n      lift off.  The remaining three GEMs were ignited in flight.\n      The GEMs were jettisoned from the first stage after motor\n      burnout.\n \n      The interstage assembly extended from the top of the first\n      stage to the second stage mini-skirt.  This assembly carried\n      loads to the first stage, and contained an exhaust vent and six\n      spring driven separation rods.\n \n      The Delta II 7925 second stage propulsion system included a\n      restartable, liquid bi-propellant Aerojet AJ10-118K engine that\n      consumed Aerozine 50 fuel (a 50/50 mix of hydrazine and\n      asymmetric dimethyl hydrazine) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4).\n      Since Aerozine 50 and nitrogen tetroxide are hypergolic, no\n      catalyst or igniter in the engine thrust chamber was required.\n      The second stage had a total propellant load of 6000 kg and\n      provided a thrust of 42,000 N.  Gaseous helium was used for\n      pressurization, and a nitrogen cold gas jet system provided\n      attitude control during coast periods and roll control during\n      powered flight.  Hydraulically activated gimbals provided pitch\n      and yaw control.  The forward section of the second stage\n      housed the guidance and control equipment that provided\n      guidance sequencing and stabilization signals for both the\n      first and second stages.  Both first and second stages had a\n      battery driven DC power system.  Separate batteries were used\n      for the guidance and control system, ordnance, and engine\n      systems.  The instrumentation and flight termination system\n      were powered by the same battery.\n \n      The Payload Assist Module D (PAM-D) was the third stage of the\n      Delta II 7925 launch vehicle and provided the final velocity\n      required to place the Pathfinder spacecraft on a trajectory to\n      Mars.  The PAM-D upper stage consisted of (1) a spin table to\n      support, rotate, and stabilize the Pathfinder spacecraft /\n      PAM-D combination before separating from the second stage, (2)\n      a Star-48B solid rocket motor for propulsion, (3) an active\n      Nutation Control System (NCS) to provide stability after\n      spin-up of the spacecraft/PAM-D stack, (4) a 3717C payload\n      attach fitting to mount the Star-48B motor to the spacecraft,\n      and (5) a yo-yo de-spin system designed to decrease the spin\n      rate of the upper stage / spacecraft stack from 70 RPM to 12\n      +/- 2 RPM.  The Star-48B provided an average thrust of 67,168 N\n      and was fueled with 2000 kg of solid propellant that was\n      composed primarily of ammonium perchlorate and aluminum.\n \n      During launch and ascent through the sensible atmosphere, the\n      Pathfinder spacecraft / PAM-D upper stage combination was\n      protected from aerodynamic forces by a 2.9 m diameter payload\n      fairing.  The payload fairing was jettisoned from the launch\n      vehicle during second stage powered flight at a minimum\n      altitude of 111 km.\n \n \n    Flight System Description\n    -------------------------\n      The Mars Pathfinder Flight System consisted of six major\n      subsystems: Attitude and Information Management (AIM);\n      Telecommunications; Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL); Power\n      and Pyrotechnics; Propulsion; and Mechanical Structure.  Brief\n      descriptions of the subsystems are given below.\n \n \n    Mechanical Structure\n    --------------------\n      The Mars Pathfinder flight system was effectively three\n      spacecraft in one.  The flight system was a standard\n      interplanetary spacecraft in one mode, an atmospheric entry\n      vehicle in another, and a surface lander in the third.  The\n      major components of the spacecraft were the cruise stage, the\n      entry vehicle (consisting of the heatshield, backshell, and\n      attached hardware), and the lander (containing the rover).\n      Components from all other subsystems were distributed through\n      each of these elements.\n \n      The purpose of the lander was to provide engineering support to\n      the science instruments and rover during surface operations.\n      The landing approach employed by Mars Pathfinder required the\n      lander to have self righting capability.  A simple tetrahedron\n      design was developed to limit the possible landing\n      orientations.  The lander was able to right itself if it landed\n      on any face of the tetrahedron by driving actuators which\n      connected three faces of the tetrahedron (the petals) with the\n      fourth (the base petal).  All thermally sensitive electronics\n      were contained in the insulated Integrated Support Assembly\n      (ISA) located inside the tetrahedron.  This enclosure provided\n      a controlled environment to minimize the effects of the extreme\n      temperature variations on Mars.  The lander high gain antenna\n      and low gain antenna were attached to the outside of the ISA,\n      as was the Imager for Mars Pathfinder.  The rover was attached\n      to one of the side petals.\n \n      A detailed description of the entry vehicle is given in the\n      following EDL subsystem description.  The cruise stage was\n      responsible for controlling the vehicle during cruise, and was\n      home to most of the components required for interplanetary\n      flight.  These included launch vehicle separation devices;\n      attitude sensors; propulsive thrusters, tanks, and other\n      equipment; cruise antennas; and solar arrays.  The cruise stage\n      was jettisoned prior to entry into the Martian atmosphere and\n      impacted the surface.  To eliminate duplication of\n      capabilities, cruise stage hardware utilized key\n      telecommunications, attitude and information management\n      services, and power support from equipment that resided on the\n      lander.  As a result, there was a significant umbilical\n      extending between the lander and cruise stage.\n \n \n    Entry, Descent, and Landing Subsystem\n    -------------------------------------\n      The Entry, Descent, and Landing subsystem was responsible for\n      safely placing the lander on the surface of Mars.  In order to\n      do this, the velocity had to be reduced from the initial entry\n      velocity of 7.6 km/s to a level that limited the maximum\n      landing shock to less than 40 g's.  Specific components of the\n      system required to do this included a 2.65 meter diameter\n      aeroshell, accelerometers, a parachute, an incremental bridle,\n      retrorockets, airbags, and a radar altimeter.\n \n      The aeroshell was used to reduce the velocity of the vehicle\n      from 7.6 km/s to .370 km/s, removing over 99% of the initial\n      kinetic energy and protecting the lander against the resultant\n      extreme aerodynamic heating.  The heatshield was a\n      Viking-heritage, 70 degree half angle blunt cone.  Thermal\n      protection was provided by Viking-heritage SLA-561V ablative\n      material.  Ablative material was also applied to the backshell\n      to protect the lander from the effects of recirculation flow\n      around the entry vehicle.  During the entry and descent phases,\n      accelerometers on the lander provided parachute deployment\n      timing information and acceleration data.  A 12.7 meter\n      diameter Viking heritage disk-gap-band parachute was used for\n      terminal descent.  The parachute was designed to open at\n      supersonic speeds with a maximum deployment dynamic pressure of\n      700 N/m^2.\n \n      The EDL system also included separation devices designed to\n      separate the heatshield from the backshell after parachute\n      deployment.  The heatshield had to be separated and released\n      from the backshell so that the lander could be deployed on the\n      incremental bridle.  The incremental bridle was designed to\n      provide separation between the backshell-mounted retrorockets\n      and the lander and to improve stability during the rocket\n      firing.  A radar altimeter on the lander was used to determine\n      when to ignite the three retrorockets.  The retrorockets were\n      sized to bring the backshell/lander system to a complete stop\n      at approximately 15 m above the surface.  Four airbags attached\n      to the faces of the tetrahedral lander were inflated just\n      before the rockets fired and were designed to limit landing\n      loads to less than 40 Earth g's.  The airbags were inflated\n      using three gas generators in 1/4 of a second.  The generators\n      continued to maintain the pressure in the airbags for over one\n      minute past initial pressurization.  Just prior to contacting\n      the surface, cable cutters released the lander from the\n      parachute, backshell, and retrorockets.  The lander hit with a\n      vertical velocity of 12 m/s and a horizontal velocity of 6 m/s.\n      After ground impact and tumbling, the airbags deflated and were\n      retracted.  The three lander petals were then opened to\n      establish an upright configuration on the surface.\n \n      All of the details of the timing for the entire EDL procedure\n      were determined in real time on board the spacecraft.\n \n \n    Attitude and Information Management Subsystem\n    ---------------------------------------------\n      The AIM subsystem performed all spacecraft computing functions\n      including command and telemetry handling, HGA pointing, payload\n      data compression, cruise attitude determination and control,\n      and EDL timing.  This subsystem was built around a single\n      high-performance (20 MIPS), 32-bit, single-board R6000\n      computer.  The computer had 128 Mbyte of dynamic RAM for flight\n      software, engineering measurements, and science data.  An\n      additional 4 Mbytes of electronically erasable PROM was\n      included to hold flight software boot code, critical sequences\n      and data.  The speed and capabilities of this computer greatly\n      simplified both software development and mission operations.\n \n      Internal interfaces within AIM were implemented using a VME bus\n      backplane.  Major VME interfaces included the Power &\n      Pyrotechnics subsystem, the Reed Solomon downlink board, the\n      hardware command decoder, and the power converter unit.  A\n      Mil-Std-1553 bus served for engineering data links to remote\n      engineering units which collected status data from the\n      celestial sensors and analog telemetry channels.  Celestial\n      sensors included a modified Magellan/IUS star scanner and a\n      five head sun sensor.  The spacecraft was spin stabilized\n      during cruise, and maintained an Earth point profile for most\n      of the flight (except for portions near Earth and Mars).  The\n      attitude determination and control system was required to\n      maintain at least 2 degrees inertial pointing throughout\n      cruise.  Attitude determination and HGA control was required\n      during the surface phase.  The autonomous pointing accuracy\n      requirement for the HGA was 3.5 degrees (note that more\n      accurate pointing was possible using downlink dithering).  The\n      AIM was also responsible for collecting and packetizing science\n      data from the instruments.\n \n      Flight software in the AIM controlled the uplink interface,\n      downlink telemetry, instrument control, engineering / science\n      data collection and formatting, bus control, sequence and\n      command processing, attitude determination / control, and power\n      / pyro functions.  The flight software design was coded in 'C'.\n      The operating system was an adaptation of VxWorks, a\n      commercially-available operating system for the R6000 computer.\n      The operating system provided a file system and an interprocess\n      communications protocol for flight software components.\n \n \n    Telecommunications Subsystem\n    ----------------------------\n      The Telecommunications subsystem provided communications\n      capability during cruise, EDL and surface operations and\n      support for radio navigation during cruise.  The baseline\n      design was a direct to Earth X-band system.  There were two\n      major elements to this subsystem: the Radio Frequency Subsystem\n      (RFS) and the Antenna Subsystem.  All RFS components were\n      located in the lander ISA.  Primary RFS functions were\n      performed by a single string Cassini transponder, a 13 watt\n      (RF) Solid State Power Amplifier, a newly developed Telemetry\n      Modulation Unit, and a Cassini Command Decoder Unit.  This\n      single string approach was designed to work for the duration of\n      the short Pathfinder mission, however, a partially redundant\n      backup downlink capability was also provided.  This backup\n      system included a small X-band transmitter with an integrated 5\n      W (RF) power amplifier and an additional TMU.  This backup\n      provided significantly less performance than the primary\n      system, but was designed to be sufficient to satisfy the\n      primary mission objectives in an emergency.\n \n      The Antenna Subsystem consisted of five antennas for cruise,\n      EDL and surface operations.  A waveguide connected the RFS in\n      the lander to a medium gain antenna (MGA) located on the cruise\n      stage.  A medium gain antenna was required to maintain a\n      minimum 20 b/s link through cruise.  The MGA was a standard\n      Mars Observer design.  Two antennas were provided for EDL\n      communications.  The backshell LGA was used during entry and\n      early parachute descent.  The EDL LGA was a whip antenna\n      attached to the top of the lander and was used during the final\n      portion of parachute descent.  Two antennas were provided on\n      the lander.  The principal antenna was a steerable high gain\n      antenna mounted on the ISA.  The HGA was a mechanically-steered\n      slotted plate with 2 degrees of freedom in pointing.  It\n      provided a nominal 125 b/s command uplink rate and a telemetry\n      downlink rate of approximately 600 b/s into a DSN 34-m antenna\n      (or 2700 b/s into a 70-m antenna).  These data rate\n      capabilities assumed 3.5 degrees pointing of the HGA.  Improved\n      pointing (using a dithering scheme with the DSN) could improve\n      these rates.  These rates were also conservative in that they\n      contained a 3 dB link margin.  A Low Gain Antenna was provided\n      for emergency situations in the event the HGA should fail.  The\n      LGA provided an emergency 7.8 b/s command uplink rate and a\n      minimum 40 b/s downlink rate over a 60 degree beam width.\n \n \n    Power and Pyrotechnics Subsystem\n    --------------------------------\n      The Power and Pyrotechnics Subsystem was responsible for\n      generating, storing and distributing power during cruise and\n      surface operations.  In addition, this subsystem was\n      responsible for controlling and initiating all pyrotechnic\n      devices required for EDL and surface operations.  Power was\n      generated during cruise by a 4.4 m^2 Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)\n      solar array which covered the top surface of the cruise stage.\n      The 5.5 mm thick cells were arranged to prevent any single\n      failures from catastrophically impacting the power output.\n      Power was generated on the surface by 2.9 m^2 of GaAs solar\n      arrays mounted on the exposed surfaces of the lander petals.\n      The lander and cruise stage used the same 5.5 mm thick cells.\n \n      A 40 amp-hr (~1120 W-hr @ 28 V) silver zinc battery was used to\n      provide energy storage during the mission.  Silver zinc\n      batteries are typically used in primary battery applications\n      (like launch vehicles), but Pathfinder re-qualified the\n      technology for use as a rechargeable battery.  The advantage of\n      this type of battery is a much higher energy density than\n      typical NiCd or NiH batteries.  The disadvantage is a\n      relatively short cycle life (limited to 30-100 cycles).  The\n      battery was only used to support launch, trajectory correction\n      maneuvers (TCMs) and surface operations, however, so the cycle\n      capability was sufficient for primary operations.\n \n      The power distribution system used an unregulated bus\n      controlled by a shunt regulator.  Pyro devices were initiated\n      using a secondary power distribution system (isolated from the\n      main) to prevent ground loop problems.  Because of the rapid\n      firing of pyros during EDL, special thermal batteries were\n      included as a backup power source for the pyro system.  The\n      pyro system was designed to provide sufficient arm and enable\n      controls to satisfy all system safety requirements.\n \n \n    Propulsion Subsystem\n    --------------------\n      The Propulsion subsystem included all equipment needed to\n      perform attitude control and TCM's during cruise and Rocket\n      Assisted Deceleration during EDL.  The cruise stage propulsion\n      system consisted of four blow-down hydrazine titanium\n      propellant tanks connected with eight 4.45 N (1 lb) thrusters\n      via series latch valves.  These thrusters were arranged to\n      allow coupled turns and both axial and transverse translational\n      maneuvers.  The purpose and function of the RAD rockets are\n      described more fully in the EDL section above.\n \n \n    Mass Summary\n    ------------\n      The spacecraft launch mass was 894 kg, including the hydrazine\n      (N2H4) propellant, science instruments, and a free-ranging\n      rover surface vehicle.  The required amount of propellant was\n      calculated using the maximum available spacecraft launch mass\n      of 905 kg.  The entry mass was 584 kg.  The entry mass was a\n      key driver on the EDL system design, so careful margin\n      management was important.\n \n \n    Spacecraft Summary\n    ------------------\n      Launch Mass:        894 kg (Includes Propellant)\n      Entry Mass:         584 kg\n      Lander Mass:        370 kg\n \n      Basic Design:\n         - Aeroshell, parachute, RAD rocket and airbag Entry, Descent,\n           and Landing (EDL) system\n         - Self righting, tetrahedral lander\n         - Active thermal design for cruise\n         - Free ranging rover\n \n      Command And Data Handling\n         - Integrated Attitude and Information Management System (AIM)\n \n      Computation\n         - R6000 Computer with VME bus, 22 Millions of Instructions Per\n           Second (MIPS), 128 Mbyte mass memory\n \n      Power\n         - Solar powered cruise stage and lander\n \n      Telemetry And Command\n         - Surface operations telemetry rate via High Gain Antenna (HGA),\n           X-Band: 6 kb/s to 70 m Deep Space Network\n         - Surface operations command rate via HGA, X-Band: 250 b/s\n \n      Propulsion\n         - Monopropellant hydrazine used for cruise\n         - Eight 4.4 N thrusters\n         - Total delta-v of 130 m/s\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    The Pathfinder radio telecommunications system was used to\n    monitor the distance between Earth and Pathfinder and its rate of\n    change in order to determine the rate of precession of Mars.\n    This utilized elements of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) in\n    addition to the instrumentation on board the spacecraft.\n \n    The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n    by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n    Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n    Administration.\n \n    The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n    communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n    solar system.

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    The Microrover Flight Experiment (MFEX), also known as the 'Mars\n    Pathfinder Rover' and 'Sojourner', is a NASA Office of Advanced\n    Concepts and Technology (OACT) flight experiment for autonomous\n    mobile vehicle technologies.  Its primary mission was to\n    determine microrover performance in the poorly understood\n    planetary terrain of Mars.  The microrover was delivered,\n    integrated with the Mars Pathfinder (MPF) Lander, to Mars on July\n    4, 1997.  After landing, the microrover was deployed from the\n    lander and began a nominal 7 sol mission, which was later\n    extended, to conduct technology experiments such as determining\n    wheel-soil interactions, autonomous navigation and hazard\n    avoidance capabilities, and engineering characterizations\n    (thermal control, power generation performance, etc.).  In\n    addition, the microrover carried an Alpha Proton X-ray\n    Spectrometer (APXS) which when deployed on rocks and soil\n    provided element composition.  Lastly, the microrover imaged the\n    lander to assist in status and damage assessment.\n \n \n    Mechanical, Thermal, and Mobility Subsystem\n    -------------------------------------------\n      The microrover is a 6-wheeled vehicle of a rocker bogie design\n      which allows the traverse of obstacles a wheel diameter (13 cm)\n      in size.  Each wheel is independently actuated and geared\n      (2000:1) providing superior climbing capability in soft sand.\n      The front and rear wheels are independently steerable,\n      providing the capability for the vehicle to turn in place.  The\n      vehicle has a top speed of 0.4 m/min.\n \n      Microrover components not designed to survive ambient Mars\n      temperatures (-110 degrees Celsius during a Martian night) are\n      contained in the warm electronics box (WEB).  The WEB is\n      insulated, coated with high and low emissivity paints, and\n      heated with a combination of 3, 1W RHUs, resistive heating\n      under computer control during the day and waste heat produced\n      by the electronics.  This design allows the WEB to maintain\n      components between -40 and +40 degrees Celsius during a Martian\n      day.\n \n \n      Control and Navigation Subsystem\n      --------------------------------- Control is provided by an\n      integrated set of computing and power distribution electronics.\n      The computer is an 80C85 rated at 100 Kips which uses, in a 16\n      Kbyte page swapping fashion, 176 Kbytes of PROM and 576 Kbytes\n      of RAM.  The computer performs I/O to some 70 sensor channels\n      and services such devices as the cameras, modem, motors and\n      experiment electronics.\n \n      Vehicle motion control is accomplished through the on/off\n      switching of the drive or steering motors.  An average of motor\n      encoder (drive) or potentiometer (steering) readings determines\n      when to switch off the motors.  When motors are off, the\n      computer conducts a proximity and hazard detection function,\n      using its laser striping and camera system to determine the\n      presence of obstacles in its path.  The vehicle is steered\n      autonomously to avoid obstacles but continues to achieve the\n      commanded goal location.  While stopped, the computer also\n      updates its measurement of distance traveled and heading using\n      the averaged odometry and on-board gyro.  This provides an\n      estimate of progress to the goal location.\n \n \n    Power Generation and Distribution\n    ---------------------------------\n      The microrover is powered by a 0.22 sqare meter solar panel\n      comprised of 13 strings of 18, 5.5 mil GaAs cells each.  The\n      solar panel is backed up by 9 LiSOCL2 D-cell sized primary\n      batteries, providing up to 150 W-hr.  This combined\n      panel/batteries system allows microrover power users to draw up\n      to 30W of peak power (mid-sol) while the peak panel production\n      is 16 W.  The normal driving power requirement for the\n      microrover is 10 W.\n \n \n    Radio Communications\n    --------------------\n      Command and telemetry is provided by modems on the microrover\n      and lander.  The microrover is the link commander of this 1/2\n      duplex, UHF system.  During the day, the microrover regularly\n      requests transmission of any commands sent from Earth and\n      stored on the lander.  When commands are not available, the\n      microrover transmits any telemetry collected during the last\n      interval between communication sessions.  The telemetry\n      received by the lander from the microrover is stored and\n      forwarded to the earth the same as any lander telemetry.  In\n      addition, this communication system is used to provide a\n      'heartbeat' signal during vehicle driving.  While stopped, the\n      microrover sends a signal to the lander.  Once acknowledged by\n      the lander, the microrover proceeds to the next stopping point\n      along its traverse.\n \n      Commands for the microrover are generated and analysis of\n      telemetry is performed at the microrover control station, a\n      Silicon Graphics workstation which is a part of the MPF ground\n      control operation.  At the end of each sol of microrover\n      traverse, the camera system on the lander takes a stereo image\n      of the vehicle in the terrain.  Those images, portions of a\n      terrain panorama and supporting images from the microrover\n      cameras, are displayed at the control station.  The operator is\n      able to designate on the display points in the terrain which\n      will serve as goal locations for the microrover traverse.  The\n      coordinates of these points are transferred into a file\n      containing the commands for execution by the microrover on the\n      next sol.  In addition, the operator can use a model which,\n      when overlayed on the image of the vehicle, measures the\n      location and heading of the vehicle.  This information is also\n      transfered into the command file to be sent to the microrover\n      on the next sol to correct any navigation errors.  This command\n      file is incorporated into the lander command stream and is sent\n      by the MPF ground control to the lander, earmarked for\n      transmission to the microrover upon request.\n \n      For more information on the Microrover Flight Experiment, see\n      the papers [MATIJEVIC1994] and [MATIJEVICETAL1997A].\n \n      Copyright 1996, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute\n      of Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space\n      Administration.",

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    For most Mars Odyssey experiments, data were collected by\n    instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed\n    via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space\n    Network (DSN) on the ground.  Radio Science observations (such\n    as radio tracking) required that DSN hardware also participate\n    in data acquisition.  The following sections provide an\n    overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground\n    system as both supported Mars Odyssey science activities.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n  =====================================\n    The Mars Odyssey spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin\n    Astronautics (LMA).  The spacecraft structure was divided into\n    two modules: the equipment module and the propulsion module.\n    The shape was not uniform, but can be approximated by\n    envisioning a box 2.2 x 1.7 x 2.6 meters.  The framework was\n    composed of aluminum and titanium.  Most spacecraft systems\n    were redundant in order to provide backup should a device fail.\n    For more information, see [JPLD-16303].\n \n    Command and Data Handling\n    -------------------------\n      This subsystem handled all computing functions for Mars\n      Odyssey.  It ran the flight software and controlled the\n      spacecraft through interface electronics.  The system was\n      based around a RAD6000 computer with 128 megabytes of\n      random access memory (RAM) and 3 megabytes non-volatile\n      memory, which allowed data to be maintained by the system\n      in the event of a power failure.  The interface\n      electronics were computer cards that communicated with\n      external peripherals.  The cards fit into the computer's\n      main board.  There were two identical sets of the\n      computer and interface electronics for back up in case\n      one failed.  One card was not redundant.  It was a one\n      gigabyte mass memory card that was used to store imaging\n      data.\n \n    Telecommunications\n    ------------------\n      The telecommunication subsystem was composed of two parts.\n      The first was a radio system that operated in the X-band\n      microwave frequency range.  It was used for communications\n      between Earth and the spacecraft.  The other system operated\n      in the ultra high frequency (UHF) range for communications\n      between future Mars landers and Odyssey.\n \n      Communication between the spacecraft and Earth occurred\n      through the use of three antennas.  The high-gain antenna was\n      a dish with 1.3 meter diameter (4.25 feet).  It was used\n      during the late Cruise and Science and relay phases of the\n      mission when data rates were high.  It simultaneously\n      received commands from Earth and transmitted science data to\n      Earth.  The medium-gain antenna was a 7.1 cm (2.8 inch) wide\n      rectangular horn antenna that protruded through the high-gain\n      dish.  The low-gain antenna was 4.4 cm (1.75 inches) and\n      provided wide- angle communications in emergencies or when\n      the high-gain antenna was not pointed directly at Earth.\n \n    Electrical Power\n    ----------------\n      A 7 square meter (75 square feet) solar panel containing an\n      array of gallium arsenide cells generated power for the\n      spacecraft.  The power distribution and drive unit sent power\n      to the electrical loads of the spacecraft through a system of\n      switches.\n \n    Guidance, Navigation and Control\n    --------------------------------\n      This subsystem used three redundant pairs of sensors to\n      determine the spacecraft's attitude.  A star camera was used\n      to look at star fields and a sun sensor detected the position\n      of the Sun in order to back up the star camera.  The inertial\n      measurement unit collected spacecraft orientation data\n      between star camera updates.  The reaction wheels along with\n      the thrusters operated to control the attitude.  There were\n      four reaction wheels - three primary and one for backup.\n      Odyssey was a three-axis stabilized spacecraft.\n \n    Propulsion\n    ----------\n      The propulsion system comprised a main engine, which aided in\n      placing Odyssey in orbit around Mars, and sets of small\n      thrusters, which performed attitude control and trajectory\n      correction maneuvers.  The main engine produced a thrust of\n      about 695 Newtons (156 pounds of force).  Each of the four\n      attitude controlling thrusters produced a thrust of 0.9\n      Newtons (0.2 pounds of force) and the four spacecraft turning\n      thrusters produced a force of 22 Newtons (5 pounds of force).\n      The propulsion system also included one gaseous helium tank\n      used to pressurize the fuel and oxidizer tanks, miscellaneous\n      tubing, pyro valves, and filters.\n \n    Structures\n    ----------\n      The spacecraft was composed of two modules - propulsion and\n      equipment.  The propulsion module contained tanks, thrusters,\n      and associated plumbing.  The equipment module consisted of\n      the equipment deck, which supported the Mars Radiation\n      Environment Experiment (MARIE), and engineering components.\n      The other component of the equipment module was the science\n      deck which housed the Thermal Emission Imaging System\n      (THEMIS), Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), High-Energy Neutron\n      Detector (HEND), Neutron Spectrometer (NS), and star cameras\n      on top and engineering components and the GRS central\n      electronics box on the underside.\n \n    Thermal Control\n    ---------------\n      A combination of heaters, radiators, louvers, blankets, and\n      thermal coatings maintained each spacecraft component's\n      temperature within its allowable limits.\n \n    Mechanisms\n    ----------\n      Odyssey functioned via several mechanisms, many of which were\n      associated with the high-gain antenna.  The antenna was\n      locked down during launch, cruise, and aerobraking through\n      three 'retention and release devices,' or latches.  The\n      antenna was released and deployed with a motor-driven hinge\n      once the science orbit around Mars was attained. A two-axis\n      gimbal assembly controlled the position of the antenna. The\n      solar array used four latches which folded together and\n      locked down the panels during launch.  After deployment, a\n      two-axis gimbal assembly controlled the solar array.  The\n      last mechanism was a latch for the deployment of the 6-meter\n      GRS boom.\n \n    Flight Software\n    ---------------\n      Odyssey received commands from Earth via radio and then\n      translated them into spacecraft actions. The flight software\n      had the capability to run many sequences concurrently in\n      addition to executing received commands immediately.\n \n      The data collection software was quite flexible.  The science\n      and engineering data were collected and then put in a variety\n      of holding bins called Application Identifiers (APIDs).  Ground\n      commands could easily modify the data routing and sampling\n      frequency.\n \n      A number of autonomous spacecraft performance functions were\n      part of the flight software.  The spacecraft ran routines\n      to control attitude and orientation without commands sent\n      from Earth.  The software also executed fault protection\n      routines to determine if any internal problem occurred.  If\n      a problem was found, a number of automatic preset actions\n      would occur to resolve the problem and put the spacecraft\n      into a standby mode until ground controllers provided\n      further direction.\n \n    Coordinate System\n    -----------------\n      The spacecraft frame is defined with the X axis parallel to\n      the stowed HGA boresight, the Y axis normal to the stowed\n      solar arrays, and the Z axis in the direction of the main\n      engine thrust (see figure below).  The origin of the frame\n      is centered on the launch vehicle separation plane.\n \n                                 _______________ HGA\n                                 \\             /\n              Science        ..   `._________.'\n               Orbit         || ._______________.\n             Velocity        || |       ^+Xsc   | Science Deck\n                ^.           || |       |       |\n                  `.         || |       |       |\n                    `.       || +Ysc    |       |\n                             ||@| <-----o +Zsc (out of page)\n                             || |               |\n                             || |               |\n                             || | Science Deck  |\n                      Solar  || ._______________.\n                      Array  ..\n \n                                   /\n                                  /\n                                 /\n                                V Nadir\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n    by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n    Technology for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space\n    Administration (NASA).\n \n    The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n    communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n    solar system.

The\n      550 kg lander had a tetrahedral structure that the air bags were\n      deployed from and surrounded, and that housed the gas generators\n      for the airbags, the RADAR altimeter, motors for the unfolding of\n      the tetrahedron's four sides or 'petals,' and the rover lift\n      mechanism for standing up the rover.  On route to Mars, the rover\n      was stowed within the lander, and contained most of the power,\n      computing, and communication electronics for all phases of the\n      mission.  The backshell and heatshield provided thermal protection\n      from the hyperbolic entry into the Martian atmosphere through the\n      use of ablating materials.  Mounted inside the backshell was the\n      parachute, the deceleration and transverse impulse solid\n      rocket (TIRS) motors, a backshell inertial measurement unit, and\n      thermal batteries for the entry and descent phase.  The Entry,\n      Descent, and Landing camera was mounted on the lander radar\n      bracket.  The Descent Image Motion Estimation Subsystem (DIMES)\n      gathered the results of a real-time image correlation of surface\n      features contained in three successive Entry, Descent, and Landing\n      camera images of the Martian surface to compute the horizontal\n      velocity of the descending vehicle. TIRS used this horizontal\n      velocity measurement along with measurements of the attitude of\n      the backshell to compute a TIRS rocket firing solution.\n \n \n    Rover on the Surface of Mars\n    ----------------------------\n      After landing, the instrument host for each spacecraft is just the\n      rover itself, which is a 6-wheeled drive, 4-wheel-steered vehicle\n      180 kg in mass, including the science package.  At its wheel base,\n      the rover is approximately 141 cm long and 122 cm wide.  At the\n      height of the solar panel, the rover is approximately 225 cm wide\n      by 151 cm long.  In its deployed configuration with the Pancam\n      Mast Assembly (PMA) deployed, the rover is 154 cm tall.\n \n      The rocker bogie suspension system gave the rover the ability to\n      drive over obstacles approximately one wheel diameter (26 cm) in\n      size while providing a stable platform for instrument\n      measurements.  The distribution of mass of the vehicle allowed the\n      vehicle to be stable even at a 45 degree tilt.  Each wheel and\n      steering degree of freedom was independently actuated, which\n      allowed the vehicle to turn in place (turning diameter 1.9 m), to\n      skid steer to a tighter angle (turning diameter as small\n      as 0.9 m), to turn in gradual arcs, or to drag wheels that\n      effectively trench the Martian regolith.  When moving on flat\n      terrain, the vehicle could achieve a top speed of 5 cm/s.  Under\n      autonomous control using its hazard avoidance system, the rover\n      drove with an average speed of about 1 cm/sec.\n \n      The rover was powered by a combination of solar arrays and\n      rechargeable batteries.  The solar panel provides 30 strings of\n      triple junction cells (gallium indium phosphorus, gallium\n      arsenide, and germanium) covering 1.3 square meters, which\n      produced about 800 to 900 W hours per sol at the beginning of the\n      MER mission.  Each rover had two reference solar cells, one that\n      measures short circuit current and another that measures open\n      circuit voltage.  Due to the change in season from late southern\n      summer to early southern autumn, and the degradation in\n      performance due to dust deposition, the energy produced by this\n      array dropped to about 600 W h per sol, 90 sols after landing.\n      Energy was stored in two 8 A h lithium ion rechargeable batteries\n      to provide over 400 W h of energy to support rover peak power\n      operations and provide auxiliary heating and operations overnight.\n \n      Temperature-sensitive electronics were housed in the rover warm\n      electronics box (WEB) which is a box built with honeycomb\n      composite material and insulated with 2.5 cm of opacified aerogel.\n      A combination of radioisotope heater units, waste heat from\n      electronics, and auxiliary heating by survival heaters ensured\n      that the internal electronics were maintained between -40 and +50\n      degrees C as the external Mars environment cycle ranged from 0 to\n      -97 degrees C.  Survival heating in the WEB requires not more than\n      100 W h of energy during the coldest environment conditions.  The\n      rechargeable batteries housed in the WEB supplied this energy.\n \n      The rover received commands and transmitted data to the Earth\n      through two distinct systems: a direct-to-Earth X-band system\n      supported by both a low-gain antenna and a steerable high-gain\n      antenna (HGA), and a UHF system supported by a monopole antenna\n      which enables relay communication to orbiters at Mars.  Early in\n      the surface mission, the X-band system through the high-gain\n      antenna supported up to 28.8 kbps to a 70 m Deep Space Network\n      (DSN) station.  Commands were received through the high-gain\n      antenna at a rate of up to 2000 bps.  The X-band system through\n      the low-gain antenna provided a minimum capability of transmitting\n      telemetry at 40 bps and receiving commands at 40 bps throughout\n      the MER missions.  The UHF system supported telemetry rates of up\n      to 256 kbps during orbiter passes which lasted up to 8 minutes\n      each.  The UHF system also supported a command receipt capability\n      of 8 kbps through Odyssey only.\n \n      The computing, command, and data handling functions of the rover\n      were supported by a 20 MHz 32-bit RAD6000 processor housed in a\n      Versa Module Europa (VME) card cage.  This radiation hardened\n      processor had access to 128 Mbytes of DRAM and 256 Mbytes of\n      nonvolatile flash memory that supported a multiprocess C-coded\n      software architecture.  This system, supported by auxiliary\n      processing functions housed on boards within the VME card cage,\n      had the capability to acquire images from pairs of cameras, drive\n      up to 10 motors simultaneously from 35 motors located on the\n      vehicle, and process data from three spectrometers.  The\n      multiprocess architecture allowed communication, image\n      acquisition, and operation of payload elements to proceed\n      simultaneously.\n \n      During the surface mission, the rovers communicated on X-band\n      typically once a day, reporting on status and the results of the\n      execution of commands transmitted that day.  Data were also\n      relayed through the UHF communication system to the Mars Global\n      Surveyor and Mars Odyssey orbiters.  Useful over-flights by these\n      orbiters at the landing site occurred as frequently as twice\n      per day per orbiter.\n \n      Each rover carried the Athena Science Payload consisting of two\n      remote sensing instruments that viewed the terrain from the top of\n      a mast 154 cm above the ground, four devices for in-situ analysis\n      on the end of a robotic arm and several magnets and calibration\n      targets.  [SQUYRESETAL2003] describes this payload, the mast, the\n      robotic arm, and the plans for science investigation in more\n      detail.  Azimuth and elevation actuators permitted the collection\n      of data sets for specific targets, regions, or full 360-degree\n      panoramas from the mast instruments, which are the stereo\n      multispectral Panoramic Camera (Pancam) and Miniature Thermal\n      Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES).  The five degree-of-freedom\n      robotic arm positioned the following devices on rocks and soils\n      for in-situ analysis or rock abrasion: Alpha Particle X-ray\n      Spectrometer (APXS), Moessbauer Spectrometer (MB), Microscopic\n      Imager (MI), and Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT).\n \n      In addition, the stereo navigation cameras (Navcams) mounted on\n      the top of the mast and the stereo hazard detection cameras\n      (Hazcams) pointed towards the ground beneath the solar panels in\n      the front and rear of the rover were required for engineering\n      purposes (rover navigation, hazard avoidance, and safe movement\n      purposes and positioning of the robotic arm), but were also used\n      for science analysis [MAKIETAL2003].  [ARVIDSONETAL2003] provides\n      more detail on the use of rover engineering sensors for assessing\n      terrain and soil physical properties, dust accumulation, and\n      other related investigations.\n \n      The MER rover coordinate frame is defined as follows:\n \n      -- +Zr axis is normal to the rover top deck plane and points down,\n         from the top deck toward the wheels;\n \n      -- +Xr axis is parallel to the rover top deck plane and points\n         from the center of the top deck toward the PMA assembly;\n \n      -- +Yr completes the right hand frame.\n \n      The origin of the MER rover 'navigation' frame is directly above\n      the middle wheels, as shown in the diagram below.  A separate\n      MER rover 'mechanical' frame has its origin 29 cm toward the\n      front wheels (in the +Xr direction) but is otherwise identical.\n \n                                 UHF    /\\\n                         HGA            \\/ PMA\n                          .--.    #     ||\n                         /    \\   #     ||\n                        |      |  #     ||\n                         \\    /=. #     ||\n                          `--' || #     ||                 Rover\n                       =======================           (deployed)\n                             |    =o=.    |\n                             |  .'

To carry out this function it is equipped with\n    high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,\n    and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n    The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n    equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at\n    Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,\n    Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of\n    the complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the\n    third is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n    Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their\n    diameters, construction, or operational characteristics:\n    70-m diameter, standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m\n    diameter (HEF), and 34-m beam waveguide (BWG).\n \n    For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - 2001 Mars Odyssey\n  ============================================\n    The 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY) spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin\n    Astronautics (LMA).

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    For most Mars Exploration Rover (MER) experiments, data were\n    collected by instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then\n    relayed directly to stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN)\n    on Earth or indirectly using the Mars orbiters Mars Global Surveyor\n    (MGS) or 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY).  MER Radio Science observations\n    required that DSN and/or ODY hardware also participate in data\n    acquisition.  The following sections provide an overview first of\n    the MER spacecraft, then of the DSN ground system, and finally of\n    2001 Mars Odyssey as each supported MER science activities.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - Rover\n  ================================\n    The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission sent two identical\n    spacecraft to two different landing sites on Mars.  The hardware on\n    the first spacecraft is referred to as MER-2 (the rover named\n    Spirit which was sent to Gusev Crater), and the hardware on\n    the second spacecraft is referred to as MER-1 (the rover named\n    Opportunity sent to Meridiani Planum).  The spacecraft design owed a\n    lot of its heritage to the Mars Pathfinder configuration for cruise\n    and entry, descent, and landing.  For more detailed information on\n    the MER spacecraft, see [CRISPETAL2003].\n \n \n    Spacecraft Configuration for Entry, Descent, and Landing\n    --------------------------------------------------------\n      After separation from the cruise stage, the 840 kg entry vehicle\n      consisted of a backshell and heatshield enclosing the lander.

To carry out this function it is equipped with\n    high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,\n    and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n    The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n    equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at\n    Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,\n    Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of\n    the complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the\n    third is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n    Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their\n    diameters, construction, or operational characteristics:\n    70-m diameter, standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m\n    diameter (HEF), and 34-m beam waveguide (BWG).\n \n    For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - 2001 Mars Odyssey\n  ============================================\n    The 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY) spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin\n    Astronautics (LMA).  Most spacecraft systems were redundant\n    in order to provide backup should a device fail.  In addition\n    to transmitting data collected by ODY instruments and systems,\n    the telecommunications system was used to relay data from Mars\n    surface assets and measure their relative motion radiometrically\n    in the 400 MHz frequency range.

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    Lunar Prospector (LP) is a small, simple, spin-stabilized spacecraft\n    with minimal operational requirements [BINDERETAL1998].  Its fueled\n    mass is 305 kg.  The spacecraft bus is a graphite-epoxy drum that is\n    1.37 m in diameter and 1.28 m tall.  Power is provided by solar\n    cells mounted on the surface of the bus assembly, which produce an\n    average of 186 w.  There is also a rechargeable, 4.8 amp-hr NiCd\n    battery for power during night side passes.  The science instruments\n    are mounted on three 2.5 m booms.  The Gamma Ray Spectrometer is\n    mounted on one boom, the Neutron Spectrometer and Alpha Particle\n    Spectrometers are mounted on another boom, and the Magnetometer and\n    Electron Reflectometer are mounted on the third boom.  The\n    Magnetometer instrument is mounted on a 1.2 m long boom extending\n    beyond the main boom to isolate it from the Electron Reflectometer.\n \n    The spacecraft bus houses three fuel tanks, six engines, and five\n    electronic units.  The fuel tanks at launch hold 138 kg of hydrazine\n    pressurized with helium.  There are two aft axial engines, two\n    forward axial engines, and two tangential engines.\n \n    The communication system consists of an S-band transponder, an omni\n    antenna with 3-pi steradian antenna pattern for uplink and downlink,\n    and a medium gain antenna for downlink.  The engineering-only\n    downlink data rate is 300 bps and the science/engineering downlink\n    data rate is 3600 bps.\n \n    Command and control of the spacecraft is achieved by a simple\n    Command and Data Handling (C&DH) unit.  As an individual command is\n    uplinked to the spacecraft, the C&DH directs the command to the\n    appropriate subsystem.  All science and engineering data are\n    collected by the C&DH and then are buffered and formatted for\n    downlink by the C&DH.  The data are downlinked at 1800 bps\n    immediately and simultaneously dumped into a solid state recorder.\n    The data stored on the solid state recorder is downlinked 53 minutes\n    later.  These delayed data frames are interleaved into the real-time\n    data stream, yielding a total downlink rate of 3600 bps.  The\n    purpose of the delayed stream is to receive data acquired during\n    communications blackout periods and to eliminate the need for a\n    commandable data recorder.\n \n    The LP spacecraft clock or frame counter increments once every 2\n    seconds.  It is stored in a 24-bit register.  This means that the\n    clock will reset after about 33.5 million seconds or about once per\n    year.  The clock reset on January 30, 1999 at about 12:09 UTC, which\n    was early in the Extended Mission.\n \n \n  Spacecraft Coordinate System\n  ============================\n    The Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) stage and spacecraft body\n    coordinate system is discussed below.  The origin of\n    coordinates is: a) in the separation plane between the\n    spacecraft and the adapter of the TLI stage; and b) at the\n    geometric center of the equilateral triangle defined by the\n    bolt holes for the separation nuts.\n \n    The Z axis is normal to the separation plane.  The +Z direction\n    is towards the medium gain antenna (forward) end of the\n    spacecraft.  The X axis is in the separation plane between the\n    spacecraft and the adapter of the TLI stage.  The -X direction\n    is parallel to the centerline of instrument boom No.  1 and\n    towards the Gamma Ray Spectrometer.  The Y axis is defined by\n    the right-hand rule.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    The Deep Space Network (DSN) is a telecommunications facility\n    managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute\n    of Technology for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space\n    Administration (NASA).\n \n    The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way communications\n    between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar system.  To\n    carry out this function it is equipped with high-power transmitters,\n    low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and\n    control systems.\n \n    The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n    equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone\n    (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and\n    Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the complexes are\n    located in the northern hemisphere while the third is in the\n    southern hemisphere.\n \n    Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their diameters,\n    construction, or operational characteristics: 70-m diameter,\n    standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter (HEF), and\n    34-m beam waveguide (BWG).  These DSN complexes, in conjunction with\n    telecommunications subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft,\n    constitute the major elements of instrumentation for radio science\n    investigations.\n \n    For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].\n \n \n  Science Packages\n  ================\n    The Lunar Prospector spacecraft has five science instruments.  The\n    instruments are a Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), a Neutron\n    Spectrometer (NS), an Alpha Particle Spectrometer (APS), a\n    Magnetometer (MAG), and an Electron Reflectometer (ER).  A Doppler\n    Gravity Experiment (DGE) uses Doppler tracking data for deriving\n    gravity measurements.  In addition, the spacecraft spin rate and\n    attitude are determined on the ground from data derived from a sun\n    sensor and an IR Earth/Moon limb crossing sensor.",

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n    =========================\n \n    The LCROSS (Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite)\n    mission was conceived as a low-cost means of determining the\n    nature of hydrogen detected at the polar regions of the moon.\n \n    LCROSS was selected as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)\n    secondary payload on April 10th, 2006 and launched with LRO on\n    June 18th, 2009.  To meet the requirements of a secondary\n    payload, the LCROSS Shepherding Spacecraft (SSC) was built\n    around an EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) ring, originally\n    designed as a mating interface for up to six small spacecraft or\n    experiments as secondary payloads on Delta IV and Atlas V\n    launches.  Developed by Northrop Grumman, the SSC featured five\n    equipment panels and a solar array mounted radially at the ESPA\n    mate ports.  A single monopropellant tank was mounted within the\n    ESPA ring.  For launch, the nearly 900 kg (wet mass) LCROSS\n    SSC was mated between the Centaur upper stage and LRO.\n \n    The SSC utilized copies of several LRO avionics units, including\n    its RAD750-based single-board computer, power and thruster\n    control electronics, S-band communications electronics, and\n    SpaceWire bus electronics.  LCROSS flight software derived\n    heavily from software on previous programs, including EO-1 and\n    WMAP.  LCROSS communicated in S-band via two omnidirectional\n    antennas and two medium-gain antennas.  Transponder electronics\n    enabled downlink at data rates up to 1 Mbps and uplink at 16\n    kbps.  Following launch and LRO separation, attitude control was\n    passed from the Centaur to the SSC.  The attitude control system\n    (ACS) provided three-axis control using an inertial reference\n    unit (IRU; no accelerometers), a star tracker, coarse sun\n    sensors for emergency automated sun-relative attitude capture\n    and tracking, and a set of eight monopropellant 5 N thrusters.\n    Two additional 22 N thrusters provided orbit maneuvering\n    capability.  The ACS featured twelve control mode/submode\n    combinations, six tailored for specific operations while\n    attached to the Centaur, and a second set for use after Centaur\n    separation.  The LCROSS propellant tank contained just over 305\n    kg of hydrazine for both attitude control and orbit maneuvering.\n    The LCROSS power system featured a 368 W solar array and four 20\n    A-h batteries.  LCROSS performed thermal control using a\n    combination of resistive heaters, passive radiators, and\n    multi-layer insulation.\n \n    The LCROSS Payload\n \n    The LCROSS Payload consists of nine science instruments, their\n    supporting electrical, mechanical and optical harnesses, a\n    central data handling unit (DHU) assembly, and thermal hardware\n    (heaters, thermistors, and thermostats), all assembled onto the\n    LCROSS spacecraft R6 Radiator Panel.  Eight of the nine science\n    instruments are configured with their apertures in the +X\n    direction (spacecraft body frame/SBF) and are accommodated in\n    the Payload Observation Deck (POD).  The ninth instrument, near\n    infrared spectrometer #2 (NSP2), has its entrance optical\n    element orientated in the -Z direction (spacecraft body\n    frame/SBF).  The Payload is located on the inboard side of the\n    LCROSS spacecraft R6 Panel.\n \n    Visible Camera\n \n    The LCROSS visible camera (VIS) is a ruggedized analog video\n    camera from the RocketCamTM camera family developed by Ecliptic\n    Enterprises, Inc.  The unit consists of a camera module and a\n    lens.  The camera's focal plane CCD sensor is 752 [H] x 582 [V]\n    pixel format, operating at 30 Hz (60 fields/sec).  The flight\n    unit's lens is a 12 mm (focal length), f/1.2 lens providing a\n    30.1 degree [H] x 22.8 degree [V] (37.8 degree [Diagonal]) field-of-view.\n    Interlaced NTSC fields are sampled by the Data Handling Unit\n    (DHU) at 720 x 243 resolution resulting in a final image\n    resolution of 720 x 486 pixels.  Each pixel is 24-bit RGB with 8\n    bits per color channel.  These images are compressed using a\n    lossy compression algorithm performed by the Analog Devices 611\n    Video Codec set on 80% quality and decompressed on the ground.\n    The LCROSS visible camera contains no cryogenic liquids or\n    moving parts.  The visible camera's peak power during operation\n    is 2.9 W.  The visible camera has been fixed to an\n    auto-gain/white balance setting.\n \n    Near-Infrared Cameras\n \n    The LCROSS payload contains two near infrared (IR) (0.9-1.7 um)\n    cameras (NIR1/NIR2).  Each camera consists of a Goodrich Sensors\n    Unlimited model SU320-KTX and a CCTV lens. Each camera's focal\n    plane InGaAs sensor has a 320 [H] x 240 [V] pixel format.  The\n    25 mm, f/1.4 C-mount glass lens provides a 28.7 degree [H] x 21.7\n    degree [V] (36.0 degree [Diagonal]) field-of-view.  Although the\n    camera's native format provides 320 [H] x 240 [V] 12-bit images,\n    the images are converted within the camera to an analog NTSC\n    signal before transfer to the DHU where they are captured at 720\n    [H] x 486 [V].  Due to similar processing within the DHU as\n    needed for the VIS images, the two NIR camera images are\n    captured as 24-bit per pixel RGB.  Because the NIR cameras\n    provide grayscale images, the three RGB channels are identical\n    except for noise introduced in the conversion to and from\n    NTSC. These images are compressed in the DHU using a lossy\n    compression algorithm performed by the Analog Devices 611 Video\n    Codec set on 80% quality and decompressed on the ground.  In\n    addition to a camera body and a lens, near infrared camera #1\n    (NIR1) also contains a long-pass filter (wavelength > 1.4 um).\n    NIR2, in comparison, is filter-less.\n \n    Lenses for both cameras were provided by UkaOptics\n    (http://www.ukaoptics.com/ #2514M) as part of the standard\n    Goodrich package. These lenses are not optimized for the IR.\n    The IR throughput of the lenses has not been documented, but is\n    expected to be ~40%.  The near-infrared cameras contain no\n    cryogenic liquids or moving parts.  There is an internal\n    thermo-electric cooler that actively cools the InGaAs sensor.\n    The manufacturer default settings for this cooler are used.\n    Each camera's peak power during operation is 1.6 W.  Both gain\n    and exposure times are configurable by commands sent to the\n    camera.\n \n    Mid-Infrared Cameras\n \n    The LCROSS payload contains two mid-infrared (MIR) (6.0-13.5 um)\n    cameras (MIR1/MIR2).  Mid-infrared camera #1 (MIR1) is a\n    ruggedized vanadium oxide (VOx) microbolometer MIRIC TB2-30,\n    from Thermoteknix Ltd.  Mid-infrared camera #2 (MIR2) is model\n    ThermoVision Micron from Flir Systems/Indigo Operations.  Each\n    camera's uncooled microbolometer focal plane sensor has a 164\n    [H] x 128 [V] pixel format and is digitized at 14-bit\n    resolution.  Each camera has a 30 mm, f/1.6 lens providing a\n    15.0 degree [H] x 11.0 degree [V] (18.6 degree [Diagonal]) field-of-view.\n    MIR1 also contains a 6-10 Om bandpass filter.  MIR2 is\n    filter-less.  MIR1 is backfilled with dry Argon gas to prevent\n    degradation due to humidity for terrestrial applications and\n    does not contain any component volatile in vacuum.  Internal to\n    both MIR modules is an instrumented-motorized shutter to provide\n    a reference for temperature measurements.  Each camera's peak\n    power during operation is 1.3 W.  A camera gain, which\n    determines the sensitivity to temperature scenes (high gain: -20\n    degC < T < +150 degC, low gain: +150 degC < T < +500 degC), is\n    configurable with a command sent to the camera.\n \n    Total Luminance Photometer\n \n    The Total Luminance Photometer (TLP) provides visible light\n    (400-1000 nm) intensity data at a 1000 Hz sampling rate.  The\n    TLP instrument consists of two elements: (1) the Sensor\n    Electronics Module (SEM), which contains the optics and sensor\n    assembly and signal filtering, and (2) the Digital Electronics\n    Module (DEM), which converts the analog sensor signal to a\n    digital output, as well as higher order functionality.  The DEM\n    is a commercial package that was modified for LCROSS.  This\n    instrument is designed and manufactured by NASA Ames Research\n    Center.  The optics in the SEM delivers an unobstructed ~10\n    degree diameter field-of-view.  The TLP's sensor element is an\n    uncooled Advanced Photonix, Inc.  (API) avalanche photo diode\n    (APD) packaged in a dryair sensor container that can operate in\n    a vacuum.  The TLP SEM is connected by an electrical harness to\n    the TLP DEM.  The SEM and DEM are located within the Payload\n    Observation Deck (POD) and on the R6 Panel, respectively.  The\n    DEM is interfaced with the DHU (also on the R6 Panel) via a\n    second cable, from which it is controlled.  The SEM and DEM's\n    peak power during operation are 2.5 W and 12.0 W, respectively.\n \n    Visible Spectrometer\n \n    The LCROSS visible spectrometer (VSP) is a modified-commercial\n    model from Ocean Optics Ltd., with its core operation based on\n    their COTS QE65000 model.  It has been adapted for space use and\n    is of similar design to a recently delivered spectrometer to Los\n    Alamos for a Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) payload for launch in\n    2011.  The VSP spectrometer design consists of an FC optical\n    fiber input (0.11 NA) feeding a 25 micron x 1 mm entrance slit,\n    where light is diffracted by a 1-inch f/4 optical cross\n    Czerny-Turner spectrometer (grating 600 lines/mm, blazed at 350\n    nm) with an oversized camera mirror.  The ~263-650 nm spectrum\n    from the slit is imaged onto a 1044 x 64 pixel Hamamatsu CCD\n    detector.  The data is co-added within the spectrometer,\n    delivering a 16- bit, 1 x 1044 pixel spectra to the DHU\n    electronics for packaging.  The first 1024 pixels contain\n    spectral data.  The remaining 20 pixels contain provide\n    temporally coincident but off-slit dark reference pixels.  The\n    VSP resolving power is R~300, 500, and 850 at 300, 400 and 600\n    nm, respectively.  The VSP contains no moving parts.  The CCD\n    detector is cooled by an internal Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC),\n    whose set point is programmable.  The VSP power is 4.8 W (TEC\n    off), and can reach 11.8 W (at TEC setting -10 degC at operating\n    temperature +19-20 degC).  Integration time (between 8 ms and 65.5\n    s) is configurable.  Additionally, the VSP supports two\n    operation modes - single and bracket spectra.  The former is a\n    single spectra acquisition of the appropriate requested\n    integration time.  The latter is a three-spectra acquisition\n    defined by a base integration time and a multiplier that is\n    divided or multiplied by the base integration time to yield a\n    shorter or longer exposure time, respectively.  The VSP is fed\n    by a 75 cm length 600-micron core-diameter UV/Vis glass fiber\n    attached to a fore-optics unit in the POD.  This fore-optics\n    unit (see below) is a fixed two-mirror and one lens system\n    designed to provide a one degree diameter field-of-view.\n \n    Near-Infrared Spectrometers\n \n    The LCROSS payload contains two near-infrared spectrometers\n    (NSP1/NSP2), located on the R6 Panel.  Their electronics units\n    are identical, but they have different fore-optics designs.\n    Near infrared spectrometer #1, NSP1, also known as the nadir\n    NSP, is located inside the POD and its aperture is positioned in\n    the +X direction (spacecraft body frame/SBF).  Near infrared\n    spectrometer #2, NSP2, also known as the solar-viewer or\n    occultation NSP, has its wide-field aperture centered along the\n    -Z direction (spacecraft body frame/SBF).  Both spectrometers\n    provide 1.20-2.45 um spectral coverage and nominal resolution\n    0.035 um/pixel, yielding resolving powers R ~ 37-65 (NSP1) and R\n    ~ 36-77 (NSP2).  Both spectrometers are manufactured by\n    Polychromix, a company whose primary spectrometer line is\n    designed for material analysis and chemical sensing.  The\n    spectrometers are designed to take a single SMA NA=0.22 fiber as\n    input instead of a slit, whose diameter defines the instrument\n    resolution.  Since each spectrometer contains a single\n    TEC-cooled InGaAs sensor element, a 1D-spectrum is created using\n    an innovative electronically-tunable MEMS device that spatially\n    masks the dispersed spectrum within the instrument.  This series\n    of masks undergoes a digital transform on the ground to recreate\n    the spectral information.  The spectrometer contains no moving\n    parts (excluding the MEMS chip) and the peak power for each NSP\n    is 2.5 W.  NSP1 and NSP2 are each fed by a single 600-micron\n    core-diameter low-OH glass fiber of length 75 cm and 1.45 m,\n    respectively, attached to a fore-optic.  The NSP1 fore-optics\n    unit (see below) is located within the POD and is a fixed\n    two-mirror and one lens system designed to provide 1 degree\n    diameter field-of-view.  The NSP2 fore-optic (see below) is a\n    diffuser providing ~130 degree fieldof- view, and is located external\n    to the POD housing.  Both spectrometers have three modes, Impact\n    Flash (IF), Hadamard Spectrum (HS) and Diagnostic Mode (DM),\n    which are configurable by sending a command to the units.\n \n    Fore-Optics and Fibers\n \n    The LCROSS payload contains two fore-optic units and three\n    fibers.  The three single-core fibers connect the electrical\n    units of the three LCROSS spectrometers to their respective\n    fore-optics (i.e., light-gathering optics).  All fibers are\n    manufactured by Fiberguide Industries.  The two fore-optics, a\n    dual-scope fore-optic feeding the NSP1 and VSP spectrometers and\n    a diffuser fore-optic feeding the NSP2 spectrometer, have been\n    designed specifically for the LCROSS mission by Aurora\n    Technologies.  The dualscope fore-optic provides 1 degree\n    diameter field-of-view (per scope) and a separation between the\n    two scopes of < 0.1 degrees.  The diffuser fore-optic provides\n    an unattenuated ~130 degree field-of-view.  The fibers were chosen to\n    optimize for the band-pass and be compatible with the throughput\n    and entrance optic requirements by the spectrometers.  For the\n    VSP, the fiber is a 75 cm SuperguideG UV/VIS Spectral Range with\n    NA=0.12+/-0.02.  For the NSPs, the fibers are AnhydroguideG Low\n    OH fibers with NA=0.22+/-0.02, with lengths 75 cm and 145 cm for\n    NSP1 and NSP2, respectively.  All three fibers have 600 Om\n    core-diameters and are encased in a 1/8 inch (ID) stainless\n    steel monocoil for ruggedization.\n \n    Data Handling Unit\n \n    The LCROSS Data Handling Unit (DHU) is a ruggedized video camera\n    controller and data handling system based on the ruggedized\n    Digital Video Systems (DVS) developed by Ecliptic Enterprises,\n    Inc.  It captures and transmits compressed digital spectrometer,\n    video and photometric data telemetry (in CCSDS format) from all\n    nine instruments from the LCROSS science payload.  The DHU is a\n    single conduction-cooled chassis designed to operate as\n    independently as possible from its host vehicle.  In the\n    limiting case, DHU operation is completely self-contained except\n    for activation/deactivation commands that originate from the\n    ground.  The DHU can store up to 10 slots of Non- Volatile\n    Memory (NVM), which can be used for sequencing power and\n    operational commands to the science instruments.  The DHU\n    contains no moving parts, operates from the 32 V power supply by\n    the spacecraft power bus, and its peak power during operation is\n    13.5 W.  The DHU also provides the time-stamping function of all\n    the science instruments and itself and provides error logs for\n    when science data frames are dropped or corrupted due to\n    bandwidth or performance issues.",

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n  =========================\n \n  For typical Radio Science experiments on other missions, the link\n  from the spacecraft to the DSN stations contains the primary science\n  content of the experiment, which makes the DSN a part of the\n  extended Radio Science instrument.  For GRAIL this is partly true.\n  There are two data types, the primary is from the links between the\n  spacecraft, and those data become available via telemetry.  The\n  second type is a one-way X-band Doppler link from each spacecraft to\n  the DSN stations. This science link supplements the LGRS on-board\n  observations and, again, make the DSN a part of the GRAIL science\n  instrumentation.  The following sections provide an overview of the\n  spacecraft and their science instruments followed by the DSN ground\n  system.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n  =====================================\n \n    Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory Spacecraft\n    ---------------------------------------------------\n    The GRAIL spacecraft design was based on the Lockheed Martin (LM)\n    Experimental Small Satellite-11 technology demonstration mission\n    for the United States Air Force, and the avionics were derived\n    from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. A single-string\n    architecture met this short mission's reliability requirements.\n    The resulting design met all GRAIL mission and science\n    requirements with ample technical margins, providing flexibility\n    to solve problems that might arise during development and which\n    met or exceeded design principles established by the Jet\n    Propulsion Laboratory.\n \n    Each of the two GRAIL spacecraft, GRAIL-A and GRAIL-B, was about\n    the size of a washing machine and had about 200 kg of mass. They\n    were nearly identical; but the need to point antennas at one\n    another required differences in the MoonKAM mounting and in the\n    angles of the star trackers used for attitude control and the\n    antennas through which the orbiters measured the changing\n    distance between them. These factors also required that GRAIL-B\n    precede GRAIL-A in lunar orbit.\n \n    Each spacecraft bus was a rectangular composite structure. The\n    science payload ranging antennas were in thermal enclosures and\n    were mounted so that they were nominally on the line between the\n    centers of mass of the two spacecraft. The other components of the\n    payload instrument were on a single interior bus panel for easy\n    integration and testing.\n \n    Two non-articulated solar arrays of XSS-11 heritage were deployed\n    just after separation from the launch vehicle. Warm gas systems,\n    identical to those on XSS-11, provided delta-V for maneuvers and\n    unloading of the 3 reaction wheels. Additional attitude sensing\n    components included an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a sun\n    sensor and a star tracker.\n \n    Command and Data Handling (C&DH), power management, and the\n    lithium ion battery also had XSS-11 heritage. The S-band\n    telecommunications sub-system for communication with the DSN used\n    components with heritage from Themis and Genesis.\n \n    The spacecraft was built and the science payload was integrated\n    and tested at Lockheed Martin's Denver facility. LM used two\n    system-level spacecraft test labs (STL) and one software simulator\n    (SoftSim) testbed with unlimited copies that enabled integration\n    and verification of all hardware and software throughout the\n    Assembly Test and Launch Operations (ATLO) cycle.\n \n    See [HOFFMAN2009] for more information about the spacecraft.\n \n    Spacecraft Configurations\n    -------------------------\n    During its mission, GRAIL needed to operate in four distinct\n    mission configurations.\n \n    Launch: During launch, the two spacecraft had to be fitted together\n    within the nose cone, or payload fairing, of the launch vehicle.\n    Large parts, such as the solar arrays, were designed to be folded\n    up.\n \n    Cruise: As soon as the two spacecraft were clear of the launch\n    vehicle, the body-fixed solar arrays were deployed to begin\n    producing power. The high-gain antenna also became operational.\n \n    Lunar Orbit Insertion: The lunar orbit insertion required numerous\n    maneuvers to circularize the two orbits. No science observations\n    took place, as the spacecraft were not in formation flying yet.\n \n    Science Operations: During the Science Phase, the two spacecraft\n    were placed in a precision formation flying configuration in order\n    to point to each other and exchange two radio links at Ka- and\n    S-bands.\n \n    Coordinate Systems\n    ------------------\n \n    Two coordinate systems are used to reference the various GRAIL\n    instruments. The definitions are summarized below.\n \n    1) Mechanical Frame (MF): This is defined by the spacecraft\n    manufacturer. It is the reference frame for such things as KBR\n    horn location, center of mass, and thruster locations.\n \n    +X = Parallel to, and in opposite direction from, the solar array\n    normal vector\n    +Z = Normal to star tracker bus plate\n    +Y = +Z ? +X\n \n    An onboard attitude control sub-system approximately orients the\n    mechanical frame with -Z along the line of flight and -/+ Y\n    pointed towards the moon.\n \n    2) Science Reference Frame (SRF): This is the Mechanical Frame as\n    realized by the Star Tracker. If the Star Tracker were perfectly\n    aligned, MF would equal SRF. SRF is the reference frame for GRAIL\n    science measurements.\n \n    Major Spacecraft Components\n    ---------------------------\n    Science Payload Instruments:\n \n    There are two payload elements on each GRAIL orbiter: the Lunar\n    Gravity Ranging System (LGRS) which is the science instrument, and\n    the MoonKAM lunar-imager which is used for Education and Public\n    Outreach. The LGRS is based on the instrument used for the Gravity\n    Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, which has been\n    mapping Earth's gravity since 2002. The LGRS is responsible for\n    sending and receiving the signals needed to accurately and\n    precisely measure the changes in range between the two orbiters.\n    The LGRS consists of an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO), Microwave\n    Assembly (MWA), a Time-Transfer Assembly (TTA), and the Gravity\n    Recovery Processor Assembly (GPA).\n \n    The USO provides a steady reference signal that is used by all of\n    the instrument subsystems. Within the LGRS, the USO provides the\n    reference frequency for the MWA and the TTA. The MWA converts the\n    USO reference signal to the Ka-band frequency, which is\n    transmitted to the other orbiter.\n \n    The function of the TTA is to provide a two-way time-transfer link\n    between the spacecraft to both synchronize and measure the clock\n    offset between the two LGRS clocks. The TTA generates an S-band\n    signal from the USO reference frequency and sends a GPS-like\n    ranging code to the other spacecraft. The GPA combines all the\n    inputs received from the MWA and TTA to produce the radiometric\n    data that are downlinked to the ground. In addition to acquiring\n    the inter-spacecraft measurements, the LGRS also provides a\n    one-way signal to the ground based on the USO, which is\n    transmitted via the X-band Radio Science Beacon (RSB). The\n    steady-state drift of the USO is measured via the one-way Doppler\n    data provided by the RSB.\n \n    The LGRS instrument is summarized below.\n \n         2 X-band beacon antennas for Doppler ranging measurements\n           when the spacecraft was visible from Earth. The X-band\n           signal was carrier-only and not\n         1 S-band time-transfer system antenna, which sent a\n           time-synchronization code back and forth between the\n           spacecraft\n         1 Ka-band ranging antenna for precision distance measurement\n           between the spacecraft\n \n    For more information on the GRAIL radio systems, see\n    [KLIPSTEINETAL2009].\n \n    Structures:\n \n    The solar panels and antennas were body fixed, so there were no\n    moving parts in the spacecraft structure that would affect science\n    observations.\n \n    Telecommunications Sub-System:\n \n    The telecom sub-system included the following on each spacecraft:\n \n         2 S-band transponder antennas to communicate with Earth\n \n    Each of the pairs of S-band transponder antennas had one antenna\n    mounted on the sunny side of the spacecraft and one mounted on the\n    dark side. The sunny-side antennas pointed to Earth during the\n    full moon and the dark-side antennas pointed to Earth during new\n    moon. This design obviated the need to mechanically rotate the\n    antennas during the mission, which would have moved the\n    spacecraft's center of mass with respect to the Ka-Band ranging\n    and X-Band beacon paths, disturbing the science measurements.\n \n    Propulsion Sub-System:\n \n    The propulsion sub-system on each spacecraft included:\n \n    A propellant tank, which could hold up to 103.5 kilograms of the\n    monopropellant hydrazine.\n \n    A hydrazine catalytic thruster for lunar-orbit insertion and\n    trajectory changes, and a warm-gas system with 8 thruster valves\n    for attitude control and other small maneuvers.\n \n    Command and Data-Handling Sub-System:\n \n    The C&DH sub-system controlled all spacecraft functions. This\n    system:\n \n         * managed all forms of data on the spacecraft;\n         * executed commands (including maneuver commands) sent from\n           Earth;\n         * prepared data for transmission to Earth;\n         * managed collection of solar power and charging of the\n           batteries;\n         * collected and processed information about all sub-systems\n           and payloads;\n         * kept and distributed the spacecraft time;\n         * calculated spacecraft position in orbit around the Moon;\n         * autonomously monitored and responded to any onboard\n           problems that occurred.\n \n    The key parts of this system were:\n \n         Space Flight Computer\n         Flight Software\n         Solid State Recorder\n \n    Attitude Control Sub-system:\n \n    The Attiude Control Sub-system (ACS) controlled the orientation of\n    the orbiter as it traveled through space and maintained knowledge\n    of where celestial bodies were located -- for example, Earth and\n    the Sun. This knowledge was critical for the spacecraft to perform\n    the correct maneuvers to get to the Moon, to keep its solar arrays\n    pointed toward the Sun for battery charging, and to keep its\n    S-Band antenna pointed toward the Earth in order to maintain\n    communications.\n \n    Once in orbit around the Moon, the ACS also maintained constant\n    knowledge of where the spacecraft was in its orbit.\n \n    The Attitude Control sub-system provided three-axis stabilized\n    control and consisted of a sun sensor, a star tracker, reaction\n    wheels, and an inertial measurement unit.\n \n    Electrical Power:\n \n    The electrical power sub-system was responsible for generating,\n    storing, and distributing power to the orbiter systems. The\n    electrical power system included two solar arrays and a lithium\n    ion battery. Each solar array was capable of producing 700 watts\n    at the end of the mission. The arrays were deployed shortly after\n    separation from the launch vehicle and remained fixed throughout\n    the mission. Each battery had a capacity of 30 amp-hours and was\n    used to provide power when the spacecraft was in the Moon's\n    shadow.\n \n    Solar panels: The only source of replenishable power is sunlight.\n    Solar panels are mounted one side of each orbiter and capable in a\n    body-fixed position.\n \n    Thermal Sub-Systems:\n \n    The thermal sub-system maintained the right temperatures in all\n    parts of the spacecraft. It employed several conduction- and\n    radiation-based techniques for thermal control.  Its components\n    included:\n \n         Radiators\n         Surface coatings\n         Thermal blankets\n         Heaters\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n \n  Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation with elements\n  both on the spacecraft and at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).\n  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine\n  telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.\n \n  The Deep Space Network was a telecommunications facility managed by\n  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n  Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n  Administration.\n \n  The primary function of the DSN was to provide two-way\n  communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar\n  system.  To carry out this function the DSN was equipped with\n  high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and\n  appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n  The DSN consisted of three complexes situated at approximately\n  equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone\n  (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and\n  Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the complexes were\n  located in the northern hemisphere while the third was in the\n  southern hemisphere.\n \n  The network comprised four subnets, each of which included one\n  antenna at each complex.  The four subnets were defined according to\n  the properties of their respective antennas: 70-m diameter, standard\n  34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter, and 26-m diameter.\n \n  These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications\n  subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft, constituted the major\n  elements of instrumentation for radio science investigations.",

The LGRS is responsible for\n    sending and receiving the signals needed to accurately and\n    precisely measure the changes in range between the two orbiters.\n    The LGRS consists of an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO), Microwave\n    Assembly (MWA), a Time-Transfer Assembly (TTA), and the Gravity\n    Recovery Processor Assembly (GPA).\n \n    The USO provides a steady reference signal that is used by all of\n    the instrument subsystems. Within the LGRS, the USO provides the\n    reference frequency for the MWA and the TTA. The MWA converts the\n    USO reference signal to the Ka-band frequency, which is\n    transmitted to the other orbiter.\n \n    The function of the TTA is to provide a two-way time-transfer link\n    between the spacecraft to both synchronize and measure the clock\n    offset between the two LGRS clocks. The TTA generates an S-band\n    signal from the USO reference frequency and sends a GPS-like\n    ranging code to the other spacecraft. The GPA combines all the\n    inputs received from the MWA and TTA to produce the radiometric\n    data that are downlinked to the ground. In addition to acquiring\n    the inter-spacecraft measurements, the LGRS also provides a\n    one-way signal to the ground based on the USO, which is\n    transmitted via the X-band Radio Science Beacon (RSB). The\n    steady-state drift of the USO is measured via the one-way Doppler\n    data provided by the RSB.\n \n    The LGRS instrument is summarized below.\n \n         2 X-band beacon antennas for Doppler ranging measurements\n           when the spacecraft was visible from Earth. The X-band\n           signal was carrier-only and not\n         1 S-band time-transfer system antenna, which sent a\n           time-synchronization code back and forth between the\n           spacecraft\n         1 Ka-band ranging antenna for precision distance measurement\n           between the spacecraft\n \n    For more information on the GRAIL radio systems, see\n    [KLIPSTEINETAL2009].\n \n    Structures:\n \n    The solar panels and antennas were body fixed, so there were no\n    moving parts in the spacecraft structure that would affect science\n    observations.\n \n    Telecommunications Sub-System:\n \n    The telecom sub-system included the following on each spacecraft:\n \n         2 S-band transponder antennas to communicate with Earth\n \n    Each of the pairs of S-band transponder antennas had one antenna\n    mounted on the sunny side of the spacecraft and one mounted on the\n    dark side. The sunny-side antennas pointed to Earth during the\n    full moon and the dark-side antennas pointed to Earth during new\n    moon. This design obviated the need to mechanically rotate the\n    antennas during the mission, which would have moved the\n    spacecraft's center of mass with respect to the Ka-Band ranging\n    and X-Band beacon paths, disturbing the science measurements.\n \n    Propulsion Sub-System:\n \n    The propulsion sub-system on each spacecraft included:\n \n    A propellant tank, which could hold up to 103.5 kilograms of the\n    monopropellant hydrazine.\n \n    A hydrazine catalytic thruster for lunar-orbit insertion and\n    trajectory changes, and a warm-gas system with 8 thruster valves\n    for attitude control and other small maneuvers.\n \n    Command and Data-Handling Sub-System:\n \n    The C&DH sub-system controlled all spacecraft functions. This\n    system:\n \n         * managed all forms of data on the spacecraft;\n         * executed commands (including maneuver commands) sent from\n           Earth;\n         * prepared data for transmission to Earth;\n         * managed collection of solar power and charging of the\n           batteries;\n         * collected and processed information about all sub-systems\n           and payloads;\n         * kept and distributed the spacecraft time;\n         * calculated spacecraft position in orbit around the Moon;\n         * autonomously monitored and responded to any onboard\n           problems that occurred.\n \n    The key parts of this system were:\n \n         Space Flight Computer\n         Flight Software\n         Solid State Recorder\n \n    Attitude Control Sub-system:\n \n    The Attiude Control Sub-system (ACS) controlled the orientation of\n    the orbiter as it traveled through space and maintained knowledge\n    of where celestial bodies were located -- for example, Earth and\n    the Sun. This knowledge was critical for the spacecraft to perform\n    the correct maneuvers to get to the Moon, to keep its solar arrays\n    pointed toward the Sun for battery charging, and to keep its\n    S-Band antenna pointed toward the Earth in order to maintain\n    communications.\n \n    Once in orbit around the Moon, the ACS also maintained constant\n    knowledge of where the spacecraft was in its orbit.\n \n    The Attitude Control sub-system provided three-axis stabilized\n    control and consisted of a sun sensor, a star tracker, reaction\n    wheels, and an inertial measurement unit.\n \n    Electrical Power:\n \n    The electrical power sub-system was responsible for generating,\n    storing, and distributing power to the orbiter systems. The\n    electrical power system included two solar arrays and a lithium\n    ion battery. Each solar array was capable of producing 700 watts\n    at the end of the mission. The arrays were deployed shortly after\n    separation from the launch vehicle and remained fixed throughout\n    the mission. Each battery had a capacity of 30 amp-hours and was\n    used to provide power when the spacecraft was in the Moon's\n    shadow.\n \n    Solar panels: The only source of replenishable power is sunlight.\n    Solar panels are mounted one side of each orbiter and capable in a\n    body-fixed position.\n \n    Thermal Sub-Systems:\n \n    The thermal sub-system maintained the right temperatures in all\n    parts of the spacecraft. It employed several conduction- and\n    radiation-based techniques for thermal control.  Its components\n    included:\n \n         Radiators\n         Surface coatings\n         Thermal blankets\n         Heaters\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n \n  Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation with elements\n  both on the spacecraft and at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).\n  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine\n  telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.\n \n  The Deep Space Network was a telecommunications facility managed by\n  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n  Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n  Administration.\n \n  The primary function of the DSN was to provide two-way\n  communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar\n  system.  To carry out this function the DSN was equipped with\n  high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and\n  appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n  The DSN consisted of three complexes situated at approximately\n  equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone\n  (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and\n  Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the complexes were\n  located in the northern hemisphere while the third was in the\n  southern hemisphere.\n \n  The network comprised four subnets, each of which included one\n  antenna at each complex.  The four subnets were defined according to\n  the properties of their respective antennas: 70-m diameter, standard\n  34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter, and 26-m diameter.\n \n  These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications\n  subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft, constituted the major\n  elements of instrumentation for radio science investigations.",

The launch mass is 530 kg, including 50 kg of chemical propellant and 65 kg of xenon gas. Two solar panel wings with a total array area of 12 square meters protrude from the side and a 1.5 m diameter high-gain parabolic antenna is mounted on top on a two-axis gimbal. A cylindrical sampler horn, deployed shortly after launch, protrudes from the bottom of the spacecraft. The Minerva lander was also mounted on th spacecraft near the bottom panel. Hayabusa is propelled during cruise phases by two microwave ion thruster engines, which use a microwave discharge to ionize xenon gas. The ionized plasma is accelerated by high-voltage electrodes through four thruster heads which protrude from one side of the spacecraft body to provide a peak thrust of 20 mN using 1 kW power. A nitrogen tetroxide/hydrazine propulsion system with a peak thrust of 22 N will be used for maneuvering. The spacecraft is powered by gallium-arsenide solar cells and a 15 A-hr rechargeable nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery. Communications are via X- and S-band low gain antennas and the high gain dish antenna (X-band) with a transmitted power of 20 W. The mission is also be equipped with a camera, used for imaging, visible-polarimetry studies, and optical navigation near the asteroid, a laser ranging device (LIDAR), and near-IR and X-ray spectrometers. The insulated and cushioned re-entry capsule, 40 cm in diameter and 25 cm deep with a mass of about 20 kg, is attached to the body of the spacecraft near the sample collection horn. The capsule has a convex nose covered with a 3 cm thick ablative heat shield to protect the samples from the high velocity (~13 km/s) re-entry. Cost of the Hayabusa spacecraft is roughly 12 billion yen ($100 million U.S.)",

The\n    spacecraft is roughly 2.5 meters across and its mass is 465 kg\n    including propellant. Design features include 64 Gbits of redundant\n    solid-state data storage, a 290 m/s propulsion budget, and the\n    capability to transmit data from 32 AU at almost 1 kilobit/second.\n \n    The instrument payload [Stern & Cheng, 2002, STERN&CHENG2002]\n    comprises the two-sensor RALPH Vis-IR remote sensing package, the\n    ALICE UV imaging spectrometer, the REX radio/radiometry experiment,\n    the two-sensor PEPSSI/SWAP plasma suite, the LORRI long-focal-length\n    imager, and the SDC student-built dust counter.\n \n \n  Payload\n  =======\n    The New Horizons team selected instruments that not only directly\n    measure NASA-specified items of interest (NASA AO 01-OSS-01, 2001,\n    [NASAAO2001]), but also provide backup to other instruments on the\n    spacecraft should one fail during the mission.\n \n    The payload comprises seven instruments:\n \n \n    RALPH\n    -----\n      The main objectives for the RALPH instrument are to obtain high\n      resolution color maps and surface composition maps of the surfaces\n      of Pluto and Charon. The instrument has two separate channels: the\n      Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) and the Linear Etalon\n      Imaging Spectral Array (LEISA). A single telescope with a 3-inch\n      (6-centimeter) aperture collects and focuses the light used in both\n      channels.\n \n      RALPH/MVIC operates at visible wavelengths and has 4 different\n      filters for producing color maps. One filter allows measurement of\n      the methane frost distribution over the surface, while the others\n      are more generic and cover blue, red and near-infrared colors,\n      respectively. MVIC also has two panchromatic filters that pass\n      essentially all visible light.  This will be useful for low-light\n      level observations requiring maximum sensitivity.  In all cases,\n      the light passes from the telescope through the filters and is\n      focused onto a charge coupled device (CCD).\n \n      RALPH/LEISA operates at infrared wavelengths, and its etalon (a filter\n      with a narrow spectral bandpass that varies linearly in one dimension)\n      is bonded to the illuminated side of the IR detector.  As a result,\n      each row of detector pixels receives only light of a particular\n      wavelength.  Spectral maps are produced by sweeping the FOV of the\n      instrument across a scene, sequentially sampling each point in the\n      scene at each wavelength.  LEISA maps the distribution of frosts of\n      methane (CH4), molecular nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), and\n      water (H2O) over the surface of Pluto and the water frost\n      distribution over the surface of Charon.  LEISA data may also reveal\n      new constituents on the surfaces that have never before been detected.\n \n    ALICE\n    -----\n      Alice is an ultraviolet imaging spectrometer that probes the\n      atmospheric composition of Pluto.\n \n      Alice has two modes of operation: an airglow mode, which measures\n      emissions from atmospheric constituents, and an occultation mode,\n      which views either the Sun or a bright star through the atmosphere\n      producing absorption by the atmospheric constituents. The Alice\n      occultation mode occurs just after New Horizons passes behind Pluto\n      and looks back at the Sun through the Pluto atmosphere.\n \n \n    REX\n    ---\n      REX is an acronym for Radio EXperiment. It is integrated into the\n      New Horizons radio telecommunications system.\n \n      Using an occultation technique similar to that described above for\n      the Alice instrument, REX probes the Pluto atmosphere. After New\n      Horizons flies by Pluto, its 2.1 meter radio antenna points back at\n      Earth. On Earth, powerful radio transmitters in the NASA Deep Space\n      Network (DSN) point at New Horizons and send radio signals to the\n      spacecraft.  As the spacecraft passes behind Pluto, the atmosphere\n      bends the radio waves by an amount that depends on the average\n      molecular weight of the gas in the atmosphere, the atmospheric\n      temperature, and the closest approach distance of the raypath at\n      each instant of time. REX samples the received radio signal and\n      sends the data back to Earth for analysis\n \n      REX also has a radiometry mode, which measures the weak radio\n      thermal emission from Pluto itself. When REX looks back at Pluto\n      following the flyby, radiometry data are taken to derive a value for\n      the Pluto nightside temperature.\n \n \n    LORRI\n    -----\n      The instrument that provides the highest spatial resolution on New\n      Horizons is LORRI - short for LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager -\n      which comprises a telescope with a 20.8cm aperture that focuses\n      visible light onto a charge coupled device (CCD). LORRI has a very\n      simple design; there are no filters or moving parts. Near the time\n      of closest approach, LORRI takes images of the Pluto surface at 100m\n      resolution.\n \n \n    SWAP\n    ----\n      The Solar Wind Analyzer around Pluto (SWAP) instrument measures\n      charged particles from the solar wind near Pluto to determine\n      whether Pluto has a magnetosphere and how fast the atmosphere is\n      escaping.\n \n \n    PEPSSI\n    ------\n      Another plasma-sensing instrument, the Pluto Energetic Particle\n      Spectrometer Science Investigation (PEPSSI), searches for neutral\n      atoms that escape the Pluto atmosphere and subsequently become\n      charged by their interaction with the solar wind.\n \n    SDC\n    ---\n      The Student Dust Counter, which was later re-named The Venetia\n      Burney Student Dust Counter (SDC), is an Education and Public\n      Outreach project.  SDC measures the dust density of the\n      Interplanetary Dust Particles (IDP) by measuring the charge\n      generated in the SDC sensor from dust impact events.  From this may\n      be inferred the size and distribution of dust particles along the\n      entire New Horizons trajectory, including regions of interplanetary\n      space never before sampled.  Such dust particles are created by\n      comets shedding material and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) colliding\n      with other KBOs.  The SDC is managed and was built primarily by\n      students at the University of Colorado in Boulder, with supervision\n      from professional space scientists.\n \n \n  Spacecraft reference frame (a.k.a. Coordinate system)\n  =====================================================\n    During hibernation and other periods of inactivity, the spacecraft is\n    designed to spin about its +Y axis, which is also the nominal\n    boresight of the High Gain Antenna (HGA) and REX.  Imaging instruments\n    have nominal boresights pointing along the -X spacecraft axis.  The\n    RTG (see Power below) is a cylinder extending out along the +X\n    spacecraft axis to keep it away from the instruments.  The +Z axis\n    completes a right-handed three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate\n    system.  Note that each instrument has its own reference frame.\n \n    The following two sketches, extracted from the SPICE Frames kernel,\n    represent the spacecraft as viewed from the spacecraft +X and +Y\n    directions.  The instrument locations are approximate; refer to\n    [STERNETAL2008] and [FOUNTAINETAL2008] for more detail.\n \n \nSpacecraft sketches\n===================\n     +X view:\n     --------\n                                     o\n                                    /|\\\n                                   / | \\\n                                  /  |  \\\n                                 /   |   \\\n                                /    |    \\\n                               /     |     \\\n           ___________________/______|______\\__________________\n           `-.

The New Horizons mission operations team\n    communicates with the spacecraft through the Deep Space Network (DSN).\n    The DSN comprises facilities in the Mojave Desert in California; near\n    Madrid, Spain; and near Canberra, Australia.\n \n \n  Power\n  =====\n    Electrical power for the New Horizons spacecraft and science\n    instruments is provided by a single radioisotope thermoelectric\n    generator, or RTG, supplied by the Department of Energy.  The New\n    Horizons trajectory takes it more than 4 billion miles from Earth,\n    where light from the Sun is 1,000 times fainter than at Earth.  An RTG\n    is used on missions, such as New Horizons, that can not use solar\n    power - yet require a proven, reliable power supply that can produce\n    up to several kilowatts of power and operate under severe\n    environmental conditions for many years.\n \n    Carrying out the New Horizons mission safely is a top priority at\n    NASA. As part of that focus, NASA informed the public about use by New\n    Horizons of an RTG by publishing a detailed Environmental Impact\n    Statement - or EIS - and several fact sheets. The Final EIS, which\n    includes public comments on the Draft EIS and the NASA responses to\n    those comments, was released in July 2005.\n \n \n  Propulsion\n  ==========\n    The propulsion system (see [FOUNTAINETAL2008], section 3) includes\n    twelve 0.8N thrusters, four 4.4N thrusters, and the hydrazine\n    propellant tank and associated control valves. The titanium\n    propellant/pressurant tank feeds the thrusters through a system\n    filter, a flow control orifice, and a set of latch valves that prevent\n    flow of the fuel until commanded to the open position after launch.\n    Helium was selected as the tank pressurant instead of nitrogen to\n    allow the loading of an additional kilogram of hydrazine. Measurements\n    of tank pressure and temperatures at various points in the system\n    allow the mission operations team to monitor system performance and\n    the amount of fuel remaining in the tank.\n \n    The 16 rocket engine assemblies (REAs) are organized into 8 sets and\n    placed on the spacecraft as shown in Figure 5. Pairs of the 0.8N\n    thrusters (each thruster from a different set) are usually fired to\n    produce torques and control rotation about one of the three spacecraft\n    axes. The one exception to the use of coupled thruster firings to\n    control spacecraft rates is that of controlling rates about the\n    spacecraft X axis during science observations, where uncoupled\n    thruster firings are required to meet the maximum spacecraft drift\n    rates allowed during this operation mode. Control rates for each of\n    the spacecraft axes are shown below in Table II. One pair of the 4.4N\n    thrusters is aligned along the -Y spacecraft axis to provide delta-V\n    for large propulsive events such as trajectory correction maneuvers\n    (TCMs). The second pair of 4.4N thrusters is aligned to produce thrust\n    along the +Y axis. These thrusters are rotated 45 degrees in the YZ\n    plane to minimize the plume impingement on the HGA dish. The net\n    propulsive effect of these thrusters is therefore reduced. They still\n    provide the required redundancy and the ability to generate thrust in\n    both directions without a 180-degree rotation of the spacecraft.\n \n    Each thruster requires a heater to warm its catalyst bed to a minimum\n    temperature prior to use. Each thruster catalyst bed has both a\n    primary and a secondary heater element, with each element drawing\n    approximately 2.2 W of power. Control of the catalyst bed heater\n    circuits is grouped functionally by pairs (to minimize the number of\n    switches required), so that a total of 16 switches control the heater\n    elements, allowing great flexibility to operate the spacecraft safely\n    while drawing the minimum required power. Operational requirements for\n    catalyst bed heater\n \n    The pulse duration and total on-time of each thruster are commanded\n    very precisely, providing accurate control of the total impulse\n    generated during a maneuver. The 0.8N thrusters can be turned on for\n    periods as short as 5 ms. The initial propellant load was allocated\n    between primary mission TCMs, attitude control (including science and\n    communication operations), and primary mission margin. At the end of\n    the primary mission, sufficient margin may allow for an extended\n    mission to one or more objects in the Kuiper Belt. The original margin\n    was augmented during the final mission preparations when the unused\n    dry mass margin was converted to additional propellant.\n \n    Given the mass and moments of inertia at launch, the delta-V\n    propellant cost is approximately 4.9 m/s/kg. A change in spin rate of\n    5 rpm (i.e., the change from the nominal spin rate to zero rpm for\n    3-axis control mode) requires approximately 0.125 kg of hydrazine.\n \n \n    Propellant budget allocations\n    -----------------------------\n                                        delta-V   Propellant\n        Description                         m/s           kg\n        -----------------------------   -------   ----------\n        Primary mission TCM                 110         22.3\n        Attitude control                    N/A         29.3\n        Primary mission margin              132         25.2\n         - original margin allocation      ( 91)       (17.5)\n         - Additional margin obtained      ( 41)       (29.3)\n           from unused spacecraft dry\n           mass allocation\n        Total navigation delta-V            242\n        Total propellant load                           76.8",

The system was capable of measuring incident plasma distribution parameters over the energy range 0.1 to 18 keV for protons and approximately 1 to 500 eV for electrons. The high-resolution analyzer with a constant of 9 keV/Q per kV applied to the plates, had a mean plate radius of 9 cm and separation of 0.5 cm. This analyzer was used to measure ions only, and had 26 channeltrons mounted on the semicircular exit to the analyzer. The aperture pointed through a wide slit in the back of the spacecraft high-gain antenna reflector and pointed along the spin axis toward the earth (and therefore the sun). The edges of the antenna reflector limited the viewing of the instrument to 73 deg with respect to the spin axis. The channeltrons covered a range of plus or minus 51 deg. Each channeltron near the center covered 3 deg and approximately 8 deg near the edges of the analyzer. The angular width perpendicular to the long angular width was about 2 deg. In half the spin period the whole cone of half-angle 51 deg centered on the sun was swept out. A medium-energy analyzer with a mean radius of 12 cm and a 1-cm plate separation (constant of 6 keV/Q per kV applied) was used to detect both ions and electrons. The detectors were five flat-surface current collectors. The three center collectors each covered 15 deg and covered the angular range of plus or minus 22.5 deg from the spin axis. The two outside collectors had an angular width of 47.5 deg and were located at plus or minus 46.25 deg from the center of the analyzer. There was a variety of possible operating modes for the experiment; however, the principal mode utilized during the encounter phase was one in which the analyzer plate potential was stepped through its range every one-half revolution of the spacecraft, and all current collectors or channeltrons were read out at the peak flux roll angle. The high and medium resolution analyzers operated independently, so a cross check between these analyzers was possible. The dynamic range for the particle fluxes was from 1.0E+2 to 3.0E+9/(sq cm-s) and the proton temperature down to 2.0E+3 deg K could be ascertained. Data include the interplanetary region.

	"display_description": "This experiment consisted of an array of five particle detectors with electron thresholds in the range .01 to 35 MeV and proton thresholds in the range 0.15 to 80 MeV. A Cerenkov counter (C) had four output channels (C1, C2, C3, and CDC) sensitive to electrons having energies above 6, 9, 13, and 1 MeV, respectively. An electron-scatter counter (E) had three output channels (E1, E2, and E3) sensitive to electrons above .16, .26, and .46 MeV. A minimum ionization counter (M) had three output channels, M1 sensitive to electrons having energies greater than 35 MeV, M2 that measured background, and M3 that was sensitive to protons having energies greater than 80 MeV. The last two sensors were scintillator detectors (SP and SE), both of which had energy thresholds of 10 keV for electrons and 150 keV for protons. The sensitivity of the SE detector to protons was about a factor of 10 lower than its sensitivity to electrons. Thus, the SEDC channel effectively measured the electron flux, which could then be subtracted from the SPDC channel response to obtain the proton flux. Several other channels, listed above, required corrections to obtain the fluxes of the species indicated. Three of the channels (CDC, SPDC, and SEDC) were read out through a common electrometer. Due to a malfunction that occurred between launch and Jovian encounter, these three channels produced no usable encounter data. The detector channels could be programmed for readout in any one of four patterns at each of the eight spacecraft bit rate modes. During encounter when the spacecraft was operating in the highest bit rate mode, the minimum time to sample one channel was 1.5 s and the time to obtain a complete scan through all channels was 108 s. Since the directional detectors pointed perpendicular to the spin axis and the spin rate was 5 rpm, pitch-angle measurements were obtained. While the experiment was primarily designated for encounter studies, some data were obtained at low rates in interplanetary space. The last data were taken on December 1, 1993, after which the instrument was turned off to conserve power for other spacecraft experiments and systems.",

The Doppler signature in the probe radio signal will be extracted on-board the orbiter and merged into the probe data stream recorded on the orbiter's solid-state recorders.\nIt is anticipated that the measurements so obtained will be so sensitive that, by having the probe transmitting antennae offset from the spin axis by just a few centimeters, it will be possible to determine the spin rate and phase of the probe. It may also be that the swinging motion of the probe beneath its parachute and other perturbations of the radio signal (e.g., atmospheric attenuation) will be detectable.",

	"display_description": "Sunlight plays a key role in driving many important physical processes in planetary physics. Absorption of UV light drives photochemical reactions, leading to changes in atmospheric composition and the production of atmospheric aerosols. The size, shape, composition and distribution of aerosols and cloud particles determine their optical properties and their ability to absorb sunlight and emit thermal infrared radiation. Thus they play a key role in the atmosphere's thermal balance. The net radiative heating or cooling rate provides the forcing for atmospheric dynamics, which in turn can affect the distribution of aerosol and cloud particles and influence climate. The composition, thermal balance, dynamics and meteorology of the atmosphere also affect (and are affected by) the nature of the surface. Surface images in reflected sunlight, together with near-IR reflection spectra, can reveal the nature of the surface and its interactions with atmospheric processes. Optical measurements of solar radiation made inside a planetary atmosphere can thus reveal a great deal about many important physical processes occurring there. The Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer (DISR) is the optical instrument aboard Huygens that makes measurements at solar wavelengths. It was developed in a collaborative effort by scientists from the US, France and Germany. DISR measures solar radiation using silicon photodiodes, a 2D silicon Charge Coupled Device (CCD) detector and two InGaAs near-IR linear array detectors. Fibre optics connect the detectors to many separate sets of foreoptics that collect light from different directions and in different spectral regions. In this way, the instrument can collect a suite of measurements that are carefully selected to answer key questions concerning the nature of Titan's surface and the composition, meteorology, thermal balance and clouds and aerosols in Titan's atmosphere.",

Three ion sources serve as detectors for the GC columns and two are dedicated to direct atmosphere sampling and ACP gas sampling, respectively.

These determined the position and motion of the orbiters, and can be used to study the Mars gravitational field, the plasma in interplanetary space, and the structure of the solar corona when the spacecraft was on the opposite side of the sun. The occultation data were obtained from these same radio links by analog recording of the signal when a spacecraft was passing into or out of occultation with Mars. The data can be used to produce altitude profiles of the temperature, density, and pressure of the atmosphere (including the ionosphere) and to measure the radius of the planet using a large number of surface points. The surface properties aspect of this investigation utilized the UHF (381 MHz) signal on which the landers transmitted data to the orbiters. At the beginning or end of a data transmission session, when the orbiter was near the lander's horizon, the strength of the received signal was recorded as a function of time. These signal \"fading patterns,\" resulting from interaction of the radio waves with the Martian surface, contain information about the physical properties of the surface near the landers.

All accelerometers have a 'proof mass' and it is the tendency of the proof mass to move relative to the case that is a measure of the acceleration of the case. Early accelerometers produced output that was directly related to acceleration; but modern sensors integrate the internally measured signal, to reduce noise, and the output is proportional to the change in velocity over the integration time. In high precision accelerometers, like those on MGS, the proof mass is an electronically floating magnetic body. The electromagnetic field is varied to keep the proof mass stationary relative to the case. The voltage required to accomplish this is proportional to the acceleration. The accelerometers on MGS are sensitive to acceleration of the center of mass (c.m.) of the s/c, pseudo-accelerations (i.e., centrifugal) due to rigid motion of the s/c about the c.m., and differences in gravitational force at the proof mass and the c.m. of the s/c (gravity gradient). The MGS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) contains four accelerometers. The principal accelerometer used in the aerobraking analysis is the z-axis accelerometer. This accelerometer is located at approximately (-0.44, -0.38, 0.72) m relative to the center of mass. The accelerometers are Sundstrand QA1200-AA08 model Q-Flex and continuously integrate acceleration to obtain velocity data. The instrument is sampled every 0.1 seconds. The data are recorded in instrument counts or quantized velocity increments equivalent to 0.332 mm/s per count. The QA1200 bias has a specified temperature sensitivity of 10 mg/K or approximately 0.3 counts/K. The temperature of the IMU assembly is actively controlled. IMU telemetered temperatures are quantized at 0.12 K and typical changes during an entire aerobraking pass are between two quantized values. Consequently, only a single, constant bias is determined for each pass through the atmosphere.",

Pancam is a multispectral, stereoscopic, panoramic imaging system consisting of two digital cameras mounted on a mast 1.5 m above the martian surface. The mast allows Pancam to image the full 360 degrees in azimuth and +/-90 degrees in elevation. Each Pancam camera utilizes a 1024 x 1024 pixel active imaging area frame transfer charge-coupled device (CCD) detector array. The Pancam optics have an effective focal length of 43 mm and a focal ratio of f/20, yielding an IFOV of 0.27 mrad/pixel and a FOV of 16 degrees x 16 degrees. Each rover's two Pancam 'eyes' are separated by 30 cm and have a 1 degree toe-in to provide adequate stereo parallax. Each eye also includes a small 8-position filter wheel to allow surface mineralogic studies, multispectral sky imaging, and direct Sun imaging, in the 400-1100 nm wavelength region. Pancam was designed and calibrated to operate within specifications on Mars at temperatures from 218 K to 278 K.

The Mini-TES is a Fourier Transform Spectrometer covering the spectral range 5-29 micrometers (339.50 to 1997.06 cm-1) with a spectral sample interval of 9.99 cm-1. The Mini-TES telescope is a 6.35-cm diameter Cassegrain telescope that feeds a flat-plate Michelson moving mirror mounted on a voice-coil motor assembly. A single deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) uncooled pyroelectric detector with proven space heritage gives a spatial resolution of 20 mrad; an actuated field stop can reduce the field of view to 8 mrad. Mini-TES is mounted within the Rover's Warm Electronics Box and views the terrain using its internal telescope looking up the hollow shaft of the Pancam Mast Assembly (PMA) to the fixed fold mirror and rotating elevation scan mirror in the PMA head located ~1.5 m above the ground. The PMA provides a full 360 degree of azimuth travel and views from 30 degrees above the nominal horizon to 50 degrees below. An interferogram is collected every two seconds, and transmitted to the Rover computer where the Fast Fourier Transform, spectral summing, lossless compression, and data formatting are performed prior to transmission to Earth. Radiometric calibration is provided by two calibration V-groove blackbody targets instrumented with platinum thermistor temperature sensors with absolute temperature calibration of +/-0.1 K. One calibration target is located inside the PMA head, the second is on the Rover deck. The Mini-TES temperature is expected to vary diurnally from 263 to 303 K, with most surface composition data collected at scene temperatures >270 K. For these conditions the radiometric precision for two-spectra summing is +/-1.8 x10-8 W cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1 between 450 and 1500 cm-1, increasing to ~4.2 x10-8 W cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1 at shorter (300 cm-1) and longer (1800 cm-1) wavenumbers. The absolute radiance error will be <5 x10-8 Watt cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1, decreasing to ~1 x10-8 Watt cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1 over the wavenumber range where the scene temperature will be determined (1200-1600 cm-1). The worst-case sum of these random and systematic radiance errors correspond to an absolute temperature error of ~0.4 K for a true surface temperature of 270 K, and ~1.5 K for a surface at 180 K. The Mini-TES will be operated in a 20-mrad panorama mode and an 8-mrad targeted mode, producing 2-dimensional rasters and 3-dimensional hyperspectral image cubes of varying sizes.",

	"display_description": "Moessbauer (MB) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for quantitative mineralogical analysis of Fe-bearing materials. The miniature MB spectrometer MIMOS II is a component of the Athena science payload to be launched to Mars in 2003 on both Mars Exploration Rover missions. The instrument has two major components: (1) a rover-based electronics board which contains power supplies, a dedicated central processing unit, memory, and associated support electronics and (2) a sensor head that is mounted at the end of the instrument deployment device (IDD) for placement of the instrument in physical contact with soil and rock. The velocity transducer operates at a nominal frequency of ~25 Hz and is configured with two 57Co/Rh MB sources. One source (~5 mCi landed intensity), together with a reference target (alpha-Fe2O3 plus alpha-Fe0) and PIN diode detector in transmission geometry, are internal to the sensor head and is used for instrument calibration. The other source (~150 mCi landed intensity), together with four PIN diodes in backscatter measurement geometry, irradiates Martian surface materials with a beam diameter of ~1.4 cm after passing through a collimator. Physical contact with surface materials is sensed with a switch-activated contact plate. The contact plate and internal reference target are instrumented with temperature sensors. Assuming ~18% Fe for Martian surface materials, experiment time is 6-12 hours during the night for quality spectra (i.e., good counting statistics); 1-2 hours is sufficient to identify and quantify the most abundant Fe-bearing phases. Data stored internal to the instrument for selectable return to Earth include MB and pulse-height analysis spectra (256 channels each) for each of the five detectors in up to 13 temperature intervals (65 MB spectra), engineering data for the velocity transducer, and temperature measurements. The total data volume is ~150 kByte. The mass and power consumption are ~500 g (~400g for the sensor head) and ~2 W, respectively. The scientific measurement objectives of the MB investigation are to obtain for rock, soil, and dust (1) the mineralogical identification of iron-bearing phases (e.g., oxides, silicates, sulfides, sulfates, and carbonates), (2) the quantitative measurement of the distribution of iron among these iron-bearing phases (e.g., the relative proportions of iron in olivine, pyroxenes, ilmenite and magnetite in a basalt), and (3) the quantitative measurement of the distribution of iron among its oxidation states (e.g., Fe2+, Fe3+, and Fe6+). Special geologic targets of the MB investigation are dust collected by the Athena magnets and exterior and interior rock and soil surfaces exposed by the Athena Rock Abrasion Tool and by trenching with rover wheels, respectively.",

	"display_description": "Each MER entry capsule contained two LITTON LN-200S Inertial Measurement Units (IMU).  One IMU was located within the rover, with the other IMU located on the backshell.  The IMU within the rover was not located at the rover's center of mass, and the IMU within the backshell was not located at the backshell's center of mass.  Neither of the two IMU's within the entry capsule was located near either the entry shell's center of mass nor the entry shell's spin axis.  The entry shell consisted of the heat shield and backshell inside of these two joined components. The four LN-200S units employed in the mission were selected from a larger population for improved stability. These LN-200S IMU's provide three-axis rotation rate and acceleration measurements.  The rotation rate is provided by a Fiber Optic Gyro (FOG) sensor, while the accelerations are provided by silicon accelerometers.  Each IMU contains three FOGs and three accelerometers, oriented orthogonally to provide measurements in three dimensions simultaneously.  The resultant measurements from each of the accelerometers and each of the FOGs is spatially transformed to the center of the IMU prior to being output by the instrument. Each IMU has a mass of 0.75 kg (1.65 pound weight), is ~9 cm by 9 cm in size, and is operated at 12 watts.  These LN-200S IMU's have space flight heritage, having been successfully flown on the Clementine mission. The accelerometers within each IMU had a dynamic range of 80g (where g here represents Earth's standard surface gravitational acceleration of 9.80665 meters per second per second) and a resolution of 2.4 milli g's, with a noise level of 1.6 milli g's when sampled at 400 Hz (the nominal instrument sampling rate). The spacecraft could not handle 400 Hz sampling, so the IMU data were summed over 50 measurements, resulting in an 8 Hz sampling by the spacecraft.  This summing has the effect of reducing the the effective noise to 300 micro g's, with an effective resolution of 50 micro g's. Atmospheric entry occurred at a nominal height of 128 km above the Mars surface at a nominal atmospheric relative velocity of 5400 m/s.  The frictional drag of the atmosphere upon the entry vehicle results in a reduction in the speed of the entry vehicle. This deceleration is measured by the accelerometers within the IMU, while the orientation of the entry vehicle is provided by the gyroscope measurements. The FOGs also provided relative orientation information for both the backshell and the lander after parachute deployment, which occurred approximately 240 seconds after entry at an altitude approximately 8.5 kilometers above the surface.  The lander separated from the backshell and descended on a tether approximately 30 seconds after parachute deployment.  Subsequent simultaneous backshell and lander (rover) IMU measurements in this tethered condition allow for the 'swing' of the lander on the tether to be determined.  This enabled removal of this motion from the accelerometer measurements, permitting a determination of the net motion of the lander toward the surface.  This allows for atmospheric profile reconstruction while the lander is still attached to the parachute.  These measurements (as well as the descent imaging) also served as part of the guidance for the horizontal motion reduction system which was included to minimize lander horizontal motion upon initial impact with the surface. The bridle connecting the lander to the backshell was severed approximately three seconds prior to surface impact.  The backshell IMU measurements ceased upon the severing of this connection.",

	"display_description": "The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) is one of the remote sensing instruments on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft that acquires orbital observations of the Martian surface during a two earth-year primary mapping phase.  MRO, successfully launched in August 2005, arrived at Mars in March 2006.  Following orbit insertion the spacecraft went into an aerobraking period to achieve a 250 x 315 kilometer near-polar orbit suitable for the Primary Science Phase (PSP) mapping that started in November 2006.  Since the start of PSP HiRISE has been continuously operating acquiring 5-20 observations per day. The HiRISE camera is a pushbroom imaging system featuring a 0.5 m aperture telescope with a 12 m focal effective length and 14 CCD detectors capable of generating images of up to 20,000 cross-scan observation pixels (exclusive of overlap pixels) and 65,000 unbinned scan lines. The HiRISE instrument capabilities include the acquisition of: (1) observations of the Mars surface from orbit with a ground sampling dimension between 25 and 32 cm/pixel, depending on the orbital altitude, along with an intrinsic point spread function of 1.4 pixels (full width at half maximum assuming no spacecraft jitter) and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), (2) high-resolution topographic data from stereo observations with a vertical precision of ~0.2 m over areas of ~5x5 pixels (~1.5 m), and (3) observations in 3 colors with high radiometric fidelity. A key instrument design feature includes Charge Couple Device (CCD) detectors with up to 128 lines of Time Delay and Integration (TDI) to create high (>100:1) SNR in the Red filter bandpass anywhere on Mars. At the nominal 300 km MRO orbital altitude the instrument can acquire image swaths of approximately 6 kilometers cross-orbit and 20 kilometers along-orbit.",

MRO's objectives are to recover climate science originally to have been conducted on the Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO), to identify and characterize sites of possible aqueous activity to which future landed missions may be sent, and to characterize the composition, geology, and stratigraphy of Martian surface deposits. MRO will operate from a sun-synchronous, near- circular (255x320 km altitude), near-polar orbit with a mean local solar time of 3 PM. CRISM's spectral range spans the ultraviolet (UV) to the mid-wave infrared (MWIR), 362 nm to 3920 nm. The instrument utilizes a Ritchey-Chretien telescope with a 2.12 degree field-of-view (FOV) to focus light on the entrance slit of a dual spectrometer. Within the spectrometer, light is split by a dichroic into VNIR (visible-near-infrared, 362-1053 nm) and IR (infrared, 1002-3920 nm) beams. Each beam is directed into a separate modified Offner spectrometer that focuses a spectrally dispersed image of the slit onto a two dimensional focal plane (FP). The IR FP is a 640 x 480 HgCdTe area array; the VNIR FP is a 640 x 480 silicon photodiode area array. The spectral image is contiguously sampled with a 6.55 nm spectral spacing and an instantaneous field of view of 61.5 microradians. The Optical\nSensor Unit (OSU) can be gimbaled to take out along-track smear, allowing long integration times that afford high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at high spectral and spatial resolution.

The campaign began in 1986 with the Pressure Modulator Infrared Radiometer (PMIRR) on the Mars Observer mission, which was lost in 1993 during the final pressurization of the spacecraft propulsion system only a few days prior to Mars orbit insertion (MOI). NASA re-selected that scientific investigation, including an enlarged science team and using the same PMIRR instrument design, for another mission, the Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO). Launched in 1998, the MCO spacecraft entered the Martian atmosphere during MOI and was destroyed. NASA selected the same team once more to build the new MCS instrument now onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). MCS is not a copy of the PMIRR instrument launched in 1992, as the 1998 PMIRR II was, but is a smaller, lighter instrument with the same scientific objectives as those of the previous two investigations. The Mars Climate Sounder is the first custom designed infrared sounder for systematic meteorological measurements at Mars, using the limb viewing technique to obtain relatively high vertical resolution of better than one pressure scale height. The application of modern technology and the use of new high performance, linear array thermopile detectors with focal plane signal processing and miniature multilayer interference and mesh filters has permitted a fivefold reduction in mass, in part by the elimination of the requirement for cryogenic operation of the focal plane. The compact dimensions of the design allow the entire instrument to be pointed to limb or nadir, for atmospheric and surface mapping respectively, and special patterns to be implemented, for example for mapping over the poles where the complex physics of the energy balance and atmospheric response during the long winter night is to be addressed.",

These are types 4 (CME_STATUS), 5 (POWER_DATA), and 6 (TABLES). Type 4 is a direct response from the FPGA that controls all aspects of MECA operations. The most common usage of this telemetry type is as a reply to routine requests including turning on LEDs for imaging, moving the microscope sample stage, deploying a chemistry actuator (sample drawer, water release, or stirring motor), or simply a status inquiry. The data return provides not only confirmation that the requested operation occurred, but specific information necessary for calibration, such as the position of the stage when the atomic force microscope is engaged. A second usage of this telemetry type is in response to a 'raw' command, a direct instruction to the FPGA to execute any of its allowed functions. While not recommended for routine science measurements, this mode is often used for operations that are not performed in the desired sequence by the standard flight software commands. Notably, this may include voltammetry and potentiometry measurements in the chemistry cells, in which case the Type 4 return contains primary science data. Type 5 data returns the voltage and current provided by the primary MECA 5V (load and logic) and 15V (load and AFM) power supplies. These results are diagnostic of the functioning of all subsystems and should be indicative of many anomalous conditions. Type 6 data returns, on request, the contents of any of six tables that modify the operation of the MECA flight software (FSW). These include a state table which is autonomously maintained by FSW as well as several tables that can only be set by explicit user command. These user-maintained tables contain the values and allowed ranges of parameters and attributes that define the implementation of each experiment. For microscopy, for example, they might define the different substrate positions on the sample wheel as well as the optimal focus position.

	"display_description": "The PHX entry capsule contained two Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) mounted on the underside of the lander on opposite sides of the spacecraft. Only one IMU was used during descent, entry and landing (EDL). The other IMU was a backup device that was not turned on. The Phoenix IMU is quasi-standard commercial product, sometimes called a Miniature IMU, or MIMU [GARAVELLIETAL1995]. This particular device was manufactured by Honeywell (Clearwater, FL) with model number YG9666BC. The IMU used three Allied Signal QFLEX accelerometers for linear acceleration measurement and three Honeywell GG1320 RLG ring-laser gyros for angular rotation measurement. However, the IMU was configured internally so that the linear accelerations were integrated and output as linear velocity changes while the gyro measurements were output as angle changes in a given sample time. No input from scientists was possible concerning the device selection and location within the lander, which was done by spacecraft engineers for the cancelled NASA Mars 2001 Lander prior to the initiation of the Phoenix project. The Phoenix lander was based on the Mars 2001 Lander design. Consequently, the IMU used during EDL of the Phoenix spacecraft was neither located at the entry vehicle center of mass nor the spin axis, which otherwise would have been desirable to optimize noise minimization for scientific purposes. At a rate of 200 Hz, the IMU output the accumulated linear velocity change (the time integral of acceleration) in three Cartesian axes and accumulated angle change (the time integral of angular rate) about three Cartesian axes. Data was saved onboard PHX at the device output rate of 200 Hz and was not down-sampled. The IMU had a mass of 3.52 kg and approximately 4051 cc volume.  Each accelerometer within the IMU had a full-scale range of 36.8g (where g represents Earth's standard surface gravitational acceleration of 9.80665 meters per second per second). The accelerometer and gyro signals were electronically integrated inside the IMU to produce an output of accumulated delta-v (linear velocity change) and delta-q (angular velocity change) at 200 Hz.  The accelerometers had two stages of digitization that resulted in pulses and then counts. The final raw digital output from the IMU accelerometers was in counts, in velocity units, where 1 output count = 0.0753 mm/sec.  But the final output moved up and down in pulses, which are leaps of many counts, with each pulse equivalent to 2.7 mm/sec. Thus, the amplitude of one pulse was equivalent to 2.7/0.0753 = 35.86 counts, on average. Added to this was noise in the system, which was on the order of 1 count, so that jumps in the raw output were typically 36 or 37 counts. This determined the digital resolution of the raw 200 Hz data to be a delta-v of 2.7 mm/sec and typical noise level of 0.0753 mm/sec. Individual gyros measure the angular rotation about one axis. Each raw IMU gyro output is a 16 bit signed integer (i.e., from -32767 to +32767) with the least significant bit (LSB) equivalent to 1 micro-radian. Because the data was generated at 200 Hz or every 5 millisecs, a full-scale value of 32768 would correspond to 375 deg/sec. (32,768 * 1 microradian /0.005 sec = 0.032768/0.005 radian/sec = 6.5536 rad/sec = 375 deg/sec). The smallest motion in a 200 Hz interval is one count, which corresponds to 0.01144 deg/sec (1 * 1 microradian /0.005 sec = 200 micro-rad/sec = 0.01144 deg/sec). Smaller angular motions can be measured over longer time periods by integration of the raw data. Noise on the raw gyro output is estimated as 45 micro-radians (3 sigma).",

	"display_description": "The Phoenix mission to Mars will advance our knowledge of the climate on Mars by combining lidar remote sensing of atmospheric dust and clouds with measurements of solar radiation and in situ sampling of temperature, pressure, wind, and water vapour. The day to day variation of the local weather on Mars is controlled primarily by the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface and this depends on the optical thickness of the dust suspended in the atmosphere. This affects local and global meteorological patterns which in turn determine the lifting of dust from the surface and long range transport. There is also a climate interaction with the distribution of water ice above and below the surface of Mars. This involves transport of water through the atmosphere and previous lidar measurements from orbit have indicated that clouds could have a substantial role. The lidar on the Phoenix mission will record the height profile of laser backscatter from the dust and cloud layers that drift past the landing site with a view that is continuous in time. The attenuation of the lidar signal can be used to derive the optical extinction coefficient and this is related to atmospheric properties. For example, the extinction of solar radiation due to dust has a first order effect on heating of the surface of Mars. The measured optical extinction can also be related to the amount of scattering material. For example, for a thin cloud the extinction coefficient measured by a lidar can be used to derive the ice water content within the cloud. Such a measurement will be of vital importance to the mission goal to investigate water on Mars. The combination of the lidar and passive remote sensing with in situ sampling will provide a view of the interacting processes that determine the local weather at the surface and also the role of the atmosphere in the water cycle on Mars. A basic atmospheric lidar (light detection and ranging) emits pulses of laser light into the atmosphere then detects and records the backscattered light as a function of time. The time resolved signal is converted to distance using the speed of light and a factor of two to account for the round-trip path length. The lidar transmitter is based on a diode pumped, passively Q-switched, neodymium-doped yttrium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. This configuration was chosen for its robustness and technological maturity as much as for its suitable lidar performance. The pump diode array emits at a wavelength of 808 nm and is used to provide the energy to the Nd:YAG crystal within the laser cavity. Lasing is inhibited within the cavity through the use of a saturable absorber. The photon density within the oscillator cavity builds to a level where the saturable absorber bleaches and the energy within the cavity is dumped as a laser pulse over a very short time (a passive Q-switch). For this laser the output light pulse has a length of approximately 10 ns and an energy of 0.7 mJ. After the laser cavity emits its light pulse, part of the optical energy is converted from a wavelength of 1064 nm to 532 nm by second harmonic generation in a Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) crystal. The laser output is then expanded by a factor of 10 in order to reduce the divergence to 0.5 mrad. A small fraction of the outgoing laser pulse is 'picked off' and separated into the two wavelength components in order to measure the relative amplitude of each wavelength with photodiodes. The signal from the photodiode detecting the 1064 nm pulse is used to trigger the data acquisition electronics, providing a zero-time reference, and also to shut off the pumping diodes.The atmospheric backscatter signals are collected by an afocal reflective telescope and split into the two relevant wavelengths using dichroic mirrors. The 1064 nm backscatter is detected by an Avalanche Photo-Diode (APD), and recorded using 14-bit analog to digital conversion (ADC). The 532 nm backscatter is detected by a Photomultiplier (PMT) and the signal is recorded using both ADC and photon counting. Photon counting is required to record the weak signals from heights above 5 km and up to 20 km.",

Both the lossy (JPEG) and lossless (Rice) compressors efficiently discard these extra bits, and compression ratios refer to the original 12-bit/pixel image (e.g., a 762-kb full frame compressed at 6:1 requires 127 kb of downlink). About 100 frames are combined into a monochromic panorama, which brings the data volume to 76 Mb; instrument and packet headers add another 5% for a total of 80 Mb. A typical day on Mars allows the return of 30 Mb of SSI data. Therefore compression is an indispensable tool for the early mission. A 6:1 compressed panorama has few artifacts, compresses to 13 Mb, and is easily returned during a single sol.

	"display_description": "The MECA Optical Microscope (OM) is part of the Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer (MECA) instrument suite. The optical, electronics, and illumination systems were designed, integrated, and tested by the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) at the University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ. It was integrated with the MECA platform, including the sample wheel and translation stage (SWTS) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, where flight qualification was also performed. Charge Coupled Device (CCD) detector and readout electronics were delivered by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS), Katlenburg-Lindau, Germany. The OM is a fixed-focus imaging system utilizing a 512 x 256 pixel active imaging area frame transfer CCD detector. It is designed to acquire images of particulate Martian material (soil, dust) at a spatial resolution of 4 microns/px. The samples to be imaged are moved to the optimum focus distance (about 14 mm away from the front end of the lens barrel) via a Sample Wheel Translation Stage (SWTS). The imaged area is then 2 mm * 1 mm. The samples are actively illuminated by red, green, blue or ultraviolet Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). Color images of these samples can be generated by combining individual images acquired with red, green and blue illumination. The SWTS is shared by the OM and the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). It contains a total of 69 substrates: 10 sets of 6 substrates plus 9 substrates holding OM and AFM calibration targets. Each set of 6 substrates consists of a weak and a strong magnet, 2 (identical) microbuckets (empty holes, 2 mm deep, 3 mm in diameter) for bulk sampling, a nanobucket (silicon textured substrate with micron-sized pits and pillar features for fixing particles and retaining the original size distribution of the acquired sample) and a sticky silicone substrate. The SWTS can be positioned to extend any one of ten sets of 6 substrates out of the MECA enclosure to receive soil samples from the Robot Arm (RA) or to collect airfall dust. Excess material is removed by passing the substrates under a blade positioned 0.2 mm above the surface, after which the samples are rotated for imaging by the OM and AFM. The overall sensitivity of the OM extends from 400 to 1020 nm and is chiefly controlled by the sensitivity of the CCD (extending from 380 to 1020 nm) and by a Schott GG420 glass filter (placed in between CCD and lens assembly) that blocks efficiently all light in the spectral range 380-400 nm. Therefore UV LED radiation (central wavelength ~ 375 nm and spectral width ~ 12 nm) cannot be directly detected by the CCD. Illuminating the target material with ultraviolet light can thus reveal fluorescence of that material. OM images belong to a series of images (Surface Stereo Imager (SSI), Robotic Arm Camera (RAC), AFM) that inspect areas of decreasing size with increasing resolution. OM images will be used to place AFM data in context.",

The data are written into permanent flash memory in real time during acquisition for later transmission.  Hundreds of images will be acquired at scales many times greater than available from orbit.\nThe MARDI science investigation primary objectives are to determine where exactly the MSL vehicle has landed and to provide a geologic and engineering-geologic framework of the landing site for early operations. The rover is expected to leave the area imaged by MARDI after the first few weeks of the mission. Vehicle horizontal offset between images within the descent sequence may permit digital elevation models (DEMs) to be created from the descent images. Additional objectives of the investigation are to examine vehicle ground-referenced motion deviations from inertial measurement unit (IMU) derived inertial position during descent to extract wind velocity from the lower boundary layer, and to help develop and test algorithms for future autonomous landing and hazard avoidance systems.

Two stereo pairs (one as a redundant backup) are mounted on the center of the front panel of the rover body with a boresight 68 cm above the base of the wheels. Two stereo pairs (one as a redundant backup) are mounted on the rear panel of the rover body with a boresight 78 cm above the base of the wheels; one pair is near the port side of the rover and the other pair is near the starboard side. Both front and rear Hazcams are pointed directly away from the rover 45 degrees off nadir. The redundant cameras are connected to the backup rover computer and are not expected to be used unless there is a problem with the primary rover computer and/or primary cameras. Each Hazcam pair assembly includes two cameras mounted to achieve a stereo view (a 16.6 cm stereo baseline for each of the front pairs, and 10 cm for each of the rear pairs). The Hazcams provide imaging primarily of the near field (< 5 m) both in front of and behind the rover. These cameras provide image data that are used by the rover computer to build range maps and perform onboard hazard detection and avoidance. They also support science operations for selecting near field targets and robotic arm operations. The Hazcams will be used to take images of the landscape that will help the rover avoid any obstacles in the way of the traverse. Each Hazcam consists of a detector head and an electronics box. The detector head houses an optical lens assembly and a Charge Coupled Device detector (CCD). The electronics box contains the CCD driver electronics, the 12-bit Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), camera/rover interface electronics, and a heater resistor that will keep the box above the minimum operating temperature of 218 K. The Hazcams use a broadband visible filter and produce 1024 x 1024 pixel images. Each camera (not including the cover) weighs 245 grams and uses approximately 2.2 Watts of power when the heater is not on. The MSL Hazcam design is identical in design to the Hazcams on the Mars Exploration Rovers with the exception of a more powerful 3.5 W heater on each MSL Hazcam and a protective cover.",

	"display_description": "The APXS (Alpha-Particle X-ray Spectrometer) for MSL is an improved version of the APXS that flew successfully on Pathfinder and the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity. The MSL APXS takes advantage of a combination of the terrestrial standard methods Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) to determine elemental chemistry. It uses curium-244 sources for X-ray spectroscopy to determine the abundance of major elements down to trace elements from sodium to bromine and beyond. The instrument consists of a main electronics unit in the rover's body and a sensor head mounted on the robotic arm. Measurements are taken by deploying the sensor head towards a desired sample, placing the sensor head in contact or hovering typically less than 2 cm away, and measuring the emitted X-ray spectrum for 15 minutes to 3 hours without the need of further interaction by the rover. At the end of the measurement, the rover retrieves the science data of 32 kilobytes, containing up to 13 consecutively taken spectra and engineering data. The internal APXS software splits the total measurement into equal time slots with an adjustable cycle time parameter. This allows us to check for repeatability and to select spectra with sufficient spectral quality. The MSL APXS can activate an internal Peltier cooler for the X-ray detector chip. This results in a sufficient spectral resolution (FWHM) of below 200 eV at 6.4 keV below ~ -5 deg C and best FWHM of <150 eV below ~ -15 deg C environmental temperature. Compared to the APXS on MER, where the best FWHM was reached at temperatures below ~ -45 deg C, this allows a significantly larger operational time window for APXS analysis. The MSL APXS has approximately 3 times the sensitivity for low Z (atomic number) elements and approximately 6 times for higher Z elements than the MER APXS. A full analysis with detection limits of 100 ppm for Ni and ~ 20 ppm for Br now requires 3 hours, while quick look analysis for major and minor elements at ~ 0.5% abundance, such as Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe, or S, can be done in 10 minutes or less. On MER, the elements detected by the APXS in rock and soil samples are typically Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Br. Elevated levels of Ge, Ga, Pb, and Rb were found in some of the MER samples. The sampled area is about 1.7 cm in diameter when the instrument is in contact with the sample. A standoff results in gradually lower intensity and an increased diameter of the measured spot.  Low Z element X-rays stem from the topmost 5 microns of the sample, higher Z elements like Fe are detected from the upper ~50 microns. Sample preparation is not needed; the APXS results average the composition over the sampled area and the oxide abundances measured are renormalized to 100%. However, on MSL, a dust removal tool (brush) is available to remove loose material from a rock surface before making an APXS measurement. \nThe major improvements and changes compared to the MER APXS are (1) improved sensitivity by a factor 3 giving full analysis within ~3 hours; (2) additional improved sensitivity for high Z elements by increased X-ray source strength; (3) operable during Martian day by using Peltier cooler for the X-ray detector; (4) basaltic calibration target mounted on the rover (on the robotic arm azimuth actuator housing), dedicated for the APXS; (5) no alpha channel (no Rutherford Backscattering spectroscopy); (6) compressed short duration X-ray spectra ( ~10 seconds ) can be used to steer the arm movement in a 'proximity mode'.",

Of particular interest is the stratigraphic record of a ~5 km thick layered rock sequence exposed on the slopes of Aeolis Mons (also known as Mount Sharp). The instrument consists of three parts, a camera head mounted on the turret at the end of a robotic arm, an electronics and data storage assembly located inside the rover body, and a calibration target mounted on the robotic arm shoulder azimuth actuator housing.  MAHLI can acquire in-focus images at working distances from ~2.1 cm to infinity. At the minimum working distance, image pixel scale is ~14 microns per pixel and very coarse silt grains can be resolved. At the working distance of the Mars Exploration Rover Microscopic Imager cameras aboard Spirit and Opportunity, MAHLI's resolution is comparable at ~30 microns per pixel.  Onboard capabilities include autofocus, auto-exposure, sub-framing, video imaging, Bayer pattern color interpolation, lossy and lossless compression, focus merging of up to 8 focus stack images, white light and longwave ultraviolet (365 nm) illumination of nearby subjects, and 8 gigabytes of non-volatile memory data storage.",

Its objective is to characterize the Martian climate and to study Mars habitability. Systematic measurement is the main driver for REMS operation. Each hour, every sol, REMS will record 5 minutes of data at 1 Hz for all sensors. This strategy will be implemented based on a high degree of autonomy in REMS operations. The instrument will wake itself up each hour and after recording and storing data, will go to sleep independently of rover operations. REMS will record data whether the rover is awake or not, and both day and night. REMS operation is designed assuming a minimum of three hours of operation each day, primarily constrained by power availability. Since the hourly observations will use a total of two hours of operational time, the third hour can be scheduled as a continuous block, for example. Another option that has been implemented in REMS flight software is a simple algorithm to lengthen some of the regular observations autonomously when an atmospheric event is detected. Depending on resources available during the mission, and the science team wishes, REMS can operate more than three hours per day.\nREMS instrument is formed by four main subsets: (1) ICU (instrument Control Unit), allowing power conditioning and distribution, analog acquisition and control of some of the sensor, thermal control loops, communications with the Booms and data processing and communications with the RCE. The ICU is composed of three boards: CPU, Analog and a DC/DC Converter. The Analog board also integrates the Pressure Sensor (PS); (2) Ultraviolet Sensor (UV), consisting of 6 photodiodes, each one devoted to a different measurement band; (3) Boom 1, hosting an Air Temperature Sensor (ATS), a Wind Sensor (WS), the Ground Temperature Sensor (GTS) and the front-end ASIC that processes all the received analog inputs from the transducers and sends the data to the ICU via a transmission link.

The objectives of the experiment were to photograph global motions and cloud distributions on Jupiter and Saturn, gross dynamical properties, zonal rotation, orientation of spin axis, zonal shear, vertical shear, flow instabilities, spots, and spectrum of scale of atmospheric motions in time and space. Additional objectives included the study of the mode of release of internal energy flux (search for convection cells and rolls), study of growth, dissipation, morphology, and vertical structure of cloud complexes, gross optical properties, global and localized scattering function in the visible spectrum, polarimetry, nature of chromophores (their structure and development), and high resolution of the Great Red Spot. The objectives of the satellite encounters included the following: (1) gross characteristics (size, shape, rotation, spin axis, cartography, improved ephemerides, and masses), (2) geology (major physiographic provinces, impact and volcanic features, lineaments, polar caps, erosion processes, low- and high-density satellite comparative studies, detection of atmospheres, frosts, and limb stratification of aerosols), and (3) surface properties (colorimetry, scattering function, nature of brightness variation, and search for new satellites). Studies of Saturn's rings included (1) resolution of individual ring components or clumps of material, (2) vertical and radial distribution of material at very high resolution, (3) scattering function, (4) coarse polarimetry, (5) occultation - optical depth, and (6) distinguishing different types of material in the rings. Other objectives were to search for new comets, asteroids, and targets of opportunity.",

Before Galileo's launch, an attempt was made to shield the star scanner's Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) from the particle environment at Jupiter.

The use of curved electric field plates in the filter results in a substantial saving of weight with respect to a conventional filter of the same resolution and angular acceptance.\n The spectrometer is controlled by a microprocessor based on a special purpose computer which has three modes of operations: full and partial survey modes and a search mode.  In the search mode, the instrument locks on to the solar wind.  This allows four times the time resolution of the full survey mode and yields a full mass spectrum every 12.6 min.",

Secondary electrons from carbon foils are detected by microchannel plate detectors and binned into a variety of data products with varying energy, mass, angle, and time resolution. To prevent detector saturation when measuring cold RAM ions at periapsis (~10**11 eV/cm**2-s-sr-eV) while maintaining adequate sensitivity to resolve tenuous pickup ions at apoapsis (~10**3 eV/cm**2-s-sreV), the sensor includes both mechanical and electrostatic attenuators that increase the dynamic range by a factor of 10**3. The STATIC sensor is mounted on the APP boom, along with NGIMS and IUVS, so that it can be pointed in the ram direction during periapsis passes.

Gamma ray measurements were used to infer the composition of Mercury's surface over localized regions using established techniques, such as used recently on the Lunar Prospector and Mars Odyssey missions.\nThe GRS detector was a coaxial germanium crystal 50 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length, chosen for its superior energy resolution and the ability to anneal the detector to remove accumulated radiation damage. The detector was rigidly clamped in a hermetically sealed Al capsule pressurized with clean, dry nitrogen. The capsule was cooled to an operating temperature in the 80-95 K range by a mechanical cryocooler. A plastic scintillator anti-coincidence shield surrounded the germanium detector in its sides and back, for rejection of cosmic-ray background. Galactic cosmic rays continuously bombard the surface of Mercury, and through interactions with the surface, gamma rays of discrete energies that are characteristic of specific elements are created. A fraction of these gamma rays, as well as those from the decay of radiogenic elements escape from the surface, where they can be detected by the orbiting GRS. Gamma-ray fluxes are measurable at altitudes up to 1000 km and for gamma rays up to about 10 MeV that emanate from depths of up to tens of centimeter beneath the surface. Detected fluxes are generally low and require numerous orbital passes over a specific region to obtain a statistically well-defined energy spectrum. The measurements of elements such as Fe, Si, Mg, Na, Al, Ca, Ti, K and Th by GRS provided insight into distinguishing between different formation models for Mercury as well as other planetary evolution issues.",

Neutron measurements were used to infer the composition of Mercury's surface over localized regions using established techniques, such as used recently on the Lunar Prospector and Mars Odyssey missions.\nThe NS sensor consisted of three scintillators, each wrapped separately and coupled to separate photo-multiplier tubes. The three scintillators were sensitive to neutrons of different energies: thermal neutrons (0.025 - 1 eV), epithermal neutrons (1 eV - 500 keV), and fast neutrons (500 keV - 7 MeV). The first and third scintillators were lithium (6Li)-glass scintillators (LG1 and LG2) that respond to a combination of thermal and epithermal neutrons. The middle scintillator was a borated plastic (BP) scintillator that responded only to epithermal and fast neutrons due to its electronics setup. The interaction of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) with the surface of Mercury produces neutrons, some of which escape the surface and produce a neutron signal that can be measured by the orbiting NS sensor. The measured neutron energy spectrum reflects the transport properties of the surface composition and is sensitive to depths down to about 1 m. Thermal neutrons are sensitive to a variety of elements, including Fe, Ti, Gd, Sm, Cl, and C. Epithermal neutrons are mostly sensitive to H abundance. Fast neutrons can provide a good measure of average atomic mass.

This technique was used previously on other orbital X-ray experiments flown on the Apollo 15, 16 and NEAR-Shoemaker missions. One GPC had a thin aluminum filter, which filtered out Si photons, one had a thin Mg filter, which filtered out Al and Si photons, and the third GPC had no filter. The energy resolution of the gas counters was sufficient to resolve higher energy lines from S, Ca, Ti, and Fe. A small Si-PIN detector was used as a solar monitor, because the Sun is the source of the planetary X-ray fluorescence.",

During the final months of the mission, the spacecraft altitude was reduced and MLA took measurements at altitudes as low as 25 km. \nThe MLA was a bi-static system, meaning that it consisted of separate transmitter and receiver systems. The transmitter used a diode-pumped, Nd:YAG slab laser. The laser output was 20 mJ per pulse at 1064-nm wavelength. The instrument measured the time required for the light to reach the surface and return. \nMLA performed active and passive radiometric measurements in a narrow spectral band centered at 1064 nm. The active measurement employed a dual-threshold measurement of pulse width to infer the area and width of the return pulse. The pulse area, together with a transmit energy monitor, provided the reflectivity of the target within a 0.08-mrad-diameter laser spot. The passive measurement employed the noise counters and threshold settings on the detector subsystem to infer radiance from a 0.4-mrad-diameter field of view.",

The high-resolution analyzer, with a constant of 9 keV/Q per kV applied to the plates, had a mean plate radius of 9 cm and separation of 0.5 cm. This analyzer which was used to measure ions. A medium-energy analyzer with a mean radius of 12 cm and a 1-cm plate separation (constant of 6 keV/Q per kV applied) was used to detect both ions and electrons. There were a variety of possible operating modes for the experiment; however, the principal mode utilized during the encounter phase was one in which the analyzer plate potential was stepped through its range every one-half revolution of the spacecraft, and all current collectors or channeltrons were read out at the peak flux roll angle. The high- and medium-resolution analyzers operated independently, so that a cross-check between these analyzers was possible. The dynamic range for the particle fluxes was from 1.0E+2 to 3.0E+9/(sq cm-s) and the proton temperature could be ascertained down to 2.0E+3 deg K.",

Development of three unique measurement functions: (1)  the step-dwell peak sampling technique, (2) the charge/velocity servo system, and (3) the explore/adapt ion mass sequencing system have proven to be essential for providing accurate ion concentration measurements compatible with both the data rate available from the spacecraft, and the high degree of variability encountered in the Venusian ionosphere.\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter Ion Mass Spectrometer (OIMS) was designed to measure cold ionospheric plasma at Venus. When ambient ions exist with energies comparable to or exceeding those of cold ions in the frame of reference of the spacecraft, which travels at ~10 km/s, the spectrometer can often detect their presence. These ''superthermal'' ions are detected as ion currents at instrument mass settings for cold ion species that are clearly not present in the environment. The energies of the superthermal ions collected could be due to thermal plasma motions and/or high bulk flow speeds (perhaps just a segment of the tail of the ion velocity distribution).",

The radio signal (approximately 2200 MHz) is transmitted from one of the three Deep Space Station antennae (Goldstone California; Madrid, Spain; or Canberra, Australia) and then received at the spacecraft.  The signal is immediately re-transmitted (there is a multiplication by 240/221 to prevent feedback into the spacecraft receiver loop) and then received at earth, where it is differenced with the originally transmitted signal.\nThe difference in frequency (the Doppler shift) can be measured to less than 0.01 Hz S band (about 0.65 mm/s) for a 5-second averaging time.  However, there are error sources which frequently degrade this accuracy.  Such things as the earth's troposphere and ionosphere, the Venus atmosphere, and space plasma cause the data noise level to increase by several factors.  The noise levels were very dynamic and changed significantly from day to day.  In some cases where solar conjunction was approaching, the noise increased by a factor of 10 or more and made the data unusable.  The data are displayed as residuals which were obtained by differencing the raw observation with the theoretical calculation.",

The occultation experiments will study the effects of the innermost coma on radio signals which pass through the coma to Earth before and after occultations of the comet nucleus and will also help determine the morphology of the nucleus. Finally, bistatic radar observations will be used to study the surface of the comet by pointing the high-gain antenna at the nucleus and bouncing the signals off the surface towards Earth, where the forward-reflected signal will reveal properties of the surface such as the roughness and dielectric constant. The primary scientific objectives of the investigations are 1) to determine the mass, bulk density, gravity field, moment of inertia, spin state, orbit, lightshift, and thermal properties of the nucleus; 2) determine the size and shape of the nucleus; 3) determine the dielectric constant and roughness of the surface of the nucleus; 4) Profile the distribution of mm-dm size particles and the plasma content of the coma; 5) aid in determination of the dust and gas flux; and 6) determine asteroid mass and bulk density during flybys.",

The spacecraft part of the radio science instrument is described immediately below. This is followed by a description of the DSN (ground) part of the instrument. Two different types of radio science investigations were conducted with Ulysses. Dual-frequency ranging and Doppler data were collected near solar conjunction to determine the density, velocity, and turbulence of coronal plasma at solar distances below 40 solar radii, i.e. within the zone of solar wind acceleration. Dual-frequency Doppler data were recorded during the Ulysses gravity assist at Jupiter in order to measure the electron content of the Io Plasma Torus.",

The dust detector consisted of 75 sq cm of a 28-micrometer polarized polymer film, with conducting surfaces. This film, of polyvinylidene fluoride, had a permanent electric dipole moment per unit volume (\"electret\") with the polarization direction normal to the film surface. Destruction of the polarization along the path of the impacting particle produced a fast current pulse which was detected by a charge-sensitive amplifier. The magnitude of the signal was a known function of the mass and the velocity of the impacting particle. Because all of the dust particles impact with the flyby speed of 78 km/s, the electronically set thresholds corresponded to known mass values. There was a second similar detector, called the veto detector, which was protected from direct dust impacts and responded only to acoustic noises generated by activities of the spacecraft. This veto detector had two output channels, set at a low and a high threshold value. The ten counting rates of the instrument also included four single counting rate channels from the four thresholds of the dust detector, and the same four channels in anti-coincidence with either the low or the high level of the veto detector. The instrument was self-calibrating either periodically or upon command, and operated normally even when a portion of the detector was destroyed by large dust particles. It was calibrated at the Heidelberg dust accelerator up to velocities of 12 km/s. The counting rates for dust particles required no correction up to 1E4 particles/s, and only a small correction for 5E4 particles/s.

A secondary goal was to make an Earth-Moon gravity tie. Specific objectives were to measure the value of gravity, relative to the value at a lunar base station, at selected known locations along the lunar traverse and to measure the value of gravity at a known point on the lunar surface (base station), relative to the gravity at a known point on Earth.",

It houses light baffles and zerodur glass primary and secondary mirrors. The filter wheel has two clear apertures and eight filters. The filters include some of the same filters used on the HRI and also have filters designed to isolate CN and C2. The camera uses a 1024 x 1024 split frame transfer CCD.
