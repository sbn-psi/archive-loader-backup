At a mean distance just over 186,000 km from Saturn, Mimas takes only 22 hours and 36 minutes to complete an orbit.

The moon creates a ring of its own as it orbits Saturn—its spray of icy particles spreads out into the space around its orbit, circling the planet to form Saturn’s E ring.

At Dione's average temperature of -304 degrees Fahrenheit (-186 degrees Celsius or 87 kelvins), ice is very hard and behaves like rock.  Very fine ice powder (equivalent to smoke) from Saturn's E-ring constantly bombards Dione. The dust in the E-ring ultimately comes from Enceladus, which has prominent geyser activity.",

The second largest of the inner satellites of Jupiter, Thebe orbits within the outer edge of the Thebe gossamer ring that is formed from dust ejected from its surface.  It is irregularly shaped and reddish in color.  Thebe was imaged in 1979 by the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, and later, in more detail, by the Galileo orbiter in the 1990s.",

Six experiments were carried as part of the science payload: television, ultraviolet spectrometer, infrared spectroscopy, infrared radiometry, S-band occultation and celestial mechanics. Two experiments (S-band occultation and celestial mechanics) utilized the radio telemetry subsystem to derive data; the other required specially developed instruments, mounted, and boresighted to each other, on the spacecraft's scan platform. Pre-launch mission planning encompassed two separate, but complementary, missions. The orbit of each spacecraft was optimized to match the corresponding objective. The mapping mission was designed with an Earth-synchronous orbit (about a 12-hr periods) to maximize antenna utilization, or communications efficiency. For maximum surveillance of an area, it was designed with a steep inclination (80 degrees) to the equatorial plane of Mars. The dynamic objective dictated a Mars-synchronous (or sub-synchronous) orbit and a lower (50 degree) inclination for closer observations of specific areas. The plans for the two missions were in detailed stages of development on May 9, 1971 when Mariner 8 was lost because of guidance difficulties in the second stage of the launch vehicle. It was determined that an orbit for a single-spacecraft mission could be developed to meet all basic mission and specific science objectives. A single-spacecraft plan, involving an inclination of 65 degrees, a period of about 12 hours, a periapsis altitude of 1350 Km, and an arrival date of November 14, 1971, was evaluated and formalized in 2 weeks.",

	"display_description": "The Viking mission to Mars consisted of four spacecraft: the two orbiters VO1 and VO2, and two landers VL1 and VL2. During cruise to Mars, the landers were attached to the orbiters; the combined spacecraft were then known as Viking 1 and 2. The role of the orbiters was to transport the landers to Mars, to carry reconnaissance instruments for certifying the landing sites, to act as relay stations for lander data, and to perform their own scientific investigations. The initial orbit periapses were placed over the candidate landing sites to allow for maximum viewing resolution and relay of the lander data. After the primary lander missions were completed, the orbiters' orbits were allowed to drift so that the entire planetary surface could be systematically mapped by the three remote sensing experiments. The Viking 1 spacecraft was launched August 20, 1975, and arrived at Mars on June 19, 1976. Lander 1 was deployed to the Mars surface on July 20, 1976. The VO1 orbital inclination of 38-39 degrees was chosen to optimize communication with VL1. Viking 2 was launched September 9, 1975 and arrived at Mars August 7, 1976. VL2 landed on September 3, 1976, at a more northerly site than VL1. The VO2 orbit was correspondingly more inclined than VO1; initially 55 degrees, it was later adjusted to 80 degrees, providing particularly good coverage of polar regions. The areocentric locations of VL1 and VL2 have since been determined to be (22.270N, 48.264W) and (47.669N, 226.032W), respectively.",

	"display_description": "Mars Observer was launched September 25, 1992 from Cape Canaveral on a Titan III built by Martin Marietta Corporation, with an upper Transfer Orbit Stage from Orbital Sciences Corporation. On August 21, 1993, flight controllers lost contact with the Mars Observer spacecraft when an expected transmission that was part of the pre-Mars-Orbit-Insertion sequence failed to occur. Subsequent attempts to re-establish communication with the spacecraft proved unsuccessful. After the 11-month transit the spacecraft was to be injected into an elliptical orbit around Mars with periapsis near the north pole. The orbit would then be adjusted through a series of maneuvers to a near-circular, sun-synchronous (2 am/pm), low altitude, near-polar orbit. Due to the non-uniformity of the gravity field, the altitude was to vary from 376 km near the south pole to 430 km near the north pole. During the Martian year in this mapping orbit the instruments were to acquire data in a systematic program of global mapping. At the end of the mission the spacecraft could have been boosted to a permanent quarantine orbit. The Mars orbit insertion (MOI) period was to end one month before solar conjunction and the beginning of the dust storm period. The playback data rate for a 10-hour link would vary by a factor of 4 with Earth-Mars distance during the mission. The continuous data rate to the tape recorders was about one fifth the playback rate for a 10-hour link to a 34 m NASA Deep Space Network tracking station. The normal sequence of collecting scientific data would be to record continuously for 24 hours and then to play the data back in one 10-hour link. The mapping orbit would be a 117-minute orbit with a 7-day repeat cycle. As a result, the planet would be repeatedly mapped in 26-day cycles with a 58.6 km nominal path separation. Orbit trim adjustments would make it possible to obtain uniform coverage during the course of the mission with an ultimate spacing of ground tracks at the equator or 3.1 km. The Mars Observer spacecraft provided a three-axis stabilized, nadir-oriented platform for the continuous observations of Mars by the science instruments. The spacecraft was built by the General Electric Astro-Space Division. The Gamma Ray Spectrometer and Magnetometer sensor assemblies were mounted on individual booms on the spacecraft. All other instruments were rigidly mounted to the spacecraft structure. No movable scan platform was provided; the spacecraft was to be continuously nadir pointed, rotating at the orbital rate. Those instruments that required scanning or multiple fields of view had internal scanning mechanisms.",

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    For most Voyager experiments, data were collected by\n    instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed\n    via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space\n    Network (DSN) on Earth.  Radio Science experiments (such as\n    radio occultations) required that DSN hardware also participate\n    in data acquisition.  The following sections provide an\n    overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground\n    system as both supported Voyager science activities.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n  =====================================\n    The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft were identical and were\n    built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  With a mass of\n    815 kilograms, each carried its own power, propulsion, and\n    communications systems and its own science instruments.\n    Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope\n    Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.\n    The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),\n    Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem\n    (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyros\n    provided physical propulsion and attitude control.\n    Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried\n    out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band\n    frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.\n    A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits\n    when no Earth station was available for real-time data\n    transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of\n    several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation\n    for days or weeks at a time.  More information on the\n    spacecraft can be found in [MORRISON1982], [KOHLHASE1989], and\n    [JPLPD618-128].\n \n    The spacecraft itself was built around its 'bus' -- a decagonal\n    prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm\n    deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a\n    'bay' containing engineering systems or science instrument\n    electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio\n    transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the\n    end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through\n    10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending\n    away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan\n    platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer\n    boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.\n \n \n    Spacecraft Coordinate System\n    ----------------------------\n      The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the\n      spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft\n      coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight\n      defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was\n      also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180\n      degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting\n      the scan platform, extended in the general direction of\n      positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle\n      90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180\n      degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  A boom supporting the RTGs\n      was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.\n      The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate\n      system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed\n      through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction\n      which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.\n      The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle\n      305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).\n \n \n    Telecommunications Subsystem\n    ----------------------------\n      The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,\n      pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic\n      reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted\n      simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and\n      X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna\n      beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.\n      The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure\n      of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the\n      hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.\n \n      The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a\n      redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed\n      functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by\n      swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit\n      science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and\n      115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band\n      link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions\n      sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per\n      second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by\n      the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the\n      Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).\n \n      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink\n      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from\n      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could\n      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the\n      received signal drifted.\n \n \n    Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem\n    -------------------------------------------\n      The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)\n      provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft\n      could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude\n      control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial\n      reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan\n      platform, upon which the four 'remote sensing' instruments\n      were mounted.\n \n      Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory\n      corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to\n      several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with\n      tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less\n      than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less\n      than 0.05 degrees per hour.\n \n      Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a\n      sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright\n      star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,\n      after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When\n      the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount\n      from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters\n      which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The\n      Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium\n      sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and\n      its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star\n      Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,\n      an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of\n      +/-0.05 degrees.\n \n      Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers\n      were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of\n      the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the\n      instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --\n      elevation and azimuth (see below).\n \n \n    Propulsion Subsystem\n    --------------------\n      The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of\n      16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to\n      control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two\n      thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to\n      perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two\n      oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative\n      roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw\n      turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform\n      negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform\n      positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to\n      perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was\n      connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.\n \n \n    Power Subsystem\n    ---------------\n      Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope\n      Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the\n      negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted\n      7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG\n      electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because\n      of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and\n      degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The\n      difference between available electrical power and the power\n      required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the\n      'power margin.' Voyager Project guidelines required a power\n      margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical\n      transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was\n      dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.\n \n \n    Data Storage Subsystem\n    ----------------------\n      The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when\n      real-time communications with Earth were either not possible\n      or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;\n      rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6\n      kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per\n      second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12\n      images or equivalent.\n \n \n    Computer Command Subsystem\n    --------------------------\n      The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two\n      identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and\n      associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central\n      controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager\n      mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used\n      non-redundantly to increase the command and processing\n      capability of the spacecraft.\n \n \n    Flight Data Subsystem\n    ---------------------\n      The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two\n      reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding\n      hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and\n      engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.\n      Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from\n      the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-\n      Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.\n      Data compression was also performed within the FDS.\n \n \n    Science Boom\n    ------------\n      The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma\n      detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged\n      particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the\n      science boom.\n \n \n    Scan Platform\n    -------------\n      Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red\n      Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)\n      were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by\n      motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan\n      platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset\n      (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;\n      the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation\n      (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform\n      azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero\n      azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators\n      were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of\n      each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error\n      of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma\n      per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and\n      Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL has shown larger\n      errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.\n      High rate slews were at 1 deg/sec, medium rate slews were at\n      0.33 deg/sec, and low rate slews were at 0.08 deg/sec.\n \n \n    Magnetometer Boom\n    -----------------\n      Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long\n      boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after\n      Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of\n      the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the\n      end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base\n      of the boom.\n \n \n    Science Sensors\n    ---------------\n      Each Voyager spacecraft carried instrumentation to support\n      eleven science investigations.  Target body (or remote\n      sensing) instruments included:\n \n      (1) Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)\n      (2) Photopolarimeter Subsystem (PPS)\n      (3) Infrared Radiometer Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS)\n      (4) Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)\n \n      Fields, waves, and particles (or in situ) sensors included:\n \n      (1) Plasma Subsystem (PLS)\n      (2) Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP)\n      (3) Cosmic-Ray Subsystem (CRS)\n      (4) Magnetic Fields (MAG)\n      (5) Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS)\n      (6) Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA)\n \n      The Radio Science (RSS) investigation was carried out using\n      the on-board and ground elements of the Telecommunications\n      Subsystem (TCS).

To carry out this function the DSN\n    is equipped with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers\n    and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n    During the Voyager era the DSN consisted of three complexes\n    situated at approximately equally spaced longitudinal intervals\n    around the globe at Goldstone (near Barstow, California),\n    Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra,\n    Australia).

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    For most Voyager experiments, data were collected by\n    instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed\n    via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space\n    Network (DSN) on Earth.  Radio Science experiments (such as\n    radio occultations) required that DSN hardware also participate\n    in data acquisition.  The following sections provide an\n    overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground\n    system as both supported Voyager science activities.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n  =====================================\n    The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft were identical and were\n    built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  With a mass of\n    815 kilograms, each carried its own power, propulsion, and\n    communications systems and its own science instruments.\n    Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope\n    Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.\n    The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),\n    Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem\n    (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyros\n    provided physical propulsion and attitude control.\n    Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried\n    out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band\n    frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.\n    A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits\n    when no Earth station was available for real-time data\n    transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of\n    several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation\n    for days or weeks at a time.  More information on the\n    spacecraft can be found in [MORRISON1982], [KOHLHASE1989], and\n    [JPLPD618-128].\n \n    The spacecraft itself was built around its 'bus' -- a decagonal\n    prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm\n    deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a\n    'bay' containing engineering systems or science instrument\n    electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio\n    transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the\n    end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through\n    10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending\n    away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan\n    platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer\n    boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.\n \n \n    Spacecraft Coordinate System\n    ----------------------------\n      The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the\n      spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft\n      coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight\n      defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was\n      also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180\n      degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting\n      the scan platform, extended in the general direction of\n      positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle\n      90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180\n      degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  A boom supporting the RTGs\n      was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.\n      The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate\n      system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed\n      through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction\n      which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.\n      The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle\n      305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).\n \n \n    Telecommunications Subsystem\n    ----------------------------\n      The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,\n      pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic\n      reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted\n      simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and\n      X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna\n      beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.\n      The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure\n      of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the\n      hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.\n \n      The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a\n      redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed\n      functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by\n      swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit\n      science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and\n      115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band\n      link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions\n      sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per\n      second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by\n      the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the\n      Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).\n \n      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink\n      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from\n      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could\n      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the\n      received signal drifted.  Unfortunately, a series of failures\n      in the Voyager 2 receivers left that transponder unable to\n      track the uplink signal.  Beginning in April 1978, Doppler\n      shifts were predicted and the uplink carrier was tuned so\n      that Voyager 2 would see what appeared to be a signal at\n      constant frequency (to an accuracy of 100 Hz).\n \n \n    Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem\n    -------------------------------------------\n      The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)\n      provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft\n      could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude\n      control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial\n      reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan\n      platform, upon which the four 'remote sensing' instruments\n      were mounted.\n \n      Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory\n      corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to\n      several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with\n      tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less\n      than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less\n      than 0.05 degrees per hour.\n \n      Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a\n      sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright\n      star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,\n      after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When\n      the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount\n      from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters\n      which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The\n      Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium\n      sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and\n      its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star\n      Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,\n      an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of\n      +/-0.05 degrees.\n \n      Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers\n      were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of\n      the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the\n      instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --\n      elevation and azimuth (see below).\n \n \n    Propulsion Subsystem\n    --------------------\n      The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of\n      16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to\n      control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two\n      thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to\n      perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two\n      oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative\n      roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw\n      turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform\n      negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform\n      positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to\n      perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was\n      connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.\n \n \n    Power Subsystem\n    ---------------\n      Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope\n      Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the\n      negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted\n      7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG\n      electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because\n      of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and\n      degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The\n      difference between available electrical power and the power\n      required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the\n      'power margin.' Voyager Project guidelines required a power\n      margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical\n      transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was\n      dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.\n \n \n    Data Storage Subsystem\n    ----------------------\n      The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when\n      real-time communications with Earth were either not possible\n      or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;\n      rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6\n      kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per\n      second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12\n      images or equivalent.\n \n \n    Computer Command Subsystem\n    --------------------------\n      The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two\n      identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and\n      associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central\n      controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager\n      mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used\n      non-redundantly to increase the command and processing\n      capability of the spacecraft.\n \n \n    Flight Data Subsystem\n    ---------------------\n      The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two\n      reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding\n      hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and\n      engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.\n      Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from\n      the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-\n      Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.\n      Data compression was also performed within the FDS.\n \n \n    Science Boom\n    ------------\n      The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma\n      detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged\n      particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the\n      science boom.\n \n \n    Scan Platform\n    -------------\n      Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red\n      Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)\n      were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by\n      motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan\n      platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset\n      (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;\n      the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation\n      (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform\n      azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero\n      azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators\n      were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of\n      each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error\n      of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma\n      per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and\n      Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL has shown larger\n      errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.\n      High rate slews of 1 deg/sec were discontinued after the\n      azimuth drive mechanism on Voyager 2 temporarily froze a\n      short time after Saturn closest approach.  The medium slew\n      rate was 0.33 deg/sec, and the low slew rate was 0.08\n      deg/sec.\n \n \n    Magnetometer Boom\n    -----------------\n      Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long\n      boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after\n      Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of\n      the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the\n      end.

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    For most Phoenix Mars Scout Lander experiments, data was collected by\n    instruments on the  spacecraft. Those data were then relayed directly\n    to stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN)  on Earth or\n    indirectly using the Mars orbiters Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) or 2001\n    Mars Odyssey  (ODY). The following sections provide an overview first\n    of the Phoenix spacecraft, then of the DSN  ground system, and finally\n    of the 2001 Mars Odyssey, as each supported Phoenix science\n    activities.\n \n  Instrument Host Description\n  ===========================\n \n    The Mars Phoenix Lander was build for the canceled Mars 2000 Lander\n    Mission. The spacecraft  was refurbished and held as the instrument\n    host for the Phoenix mission [SMITHETAL2008]. Phoenix  was the first\n    of the Scout class mission and consisted of a single lander with\n    associated  instrumentation. The Lander was about 18 feet (5.5 meters)\n    long with the solar panels deployed, and  the science deck by itself\n    was about 5 feet (1.5 meters) in diameter. From the ground to the top\n    of the  MET mast, the Lander measured about 7 feet (2.2 meters) tall.\n    The Lander weighed 350 kg, or 770 lbs.  It was launched on August 4,\n    2007, on a Delta II 7925 launch vehicle, and was operational until\n    November 2, 2008, performing on the Martian surface for 152 sols.\n \n    Power was generated during the cruise stage by two gallium arsenide\n    solar panels (total area  3.1 m2, or 33 ft2) mounted to the cruise\n    stage. After touchdown, Phoenix relied on two octagonal  gallium\n    arsenide solar panel wings extending from the Lander base to charge\n    its battery for operations.  Input from the solar panels was\n    sufficient to power daytime operations, but nighttime operations\n    required additional power from the Lander heater system.\n \n    Phoenix communicated directly with Earth using the X-band portion of\n    the radio spectrum (8  to 12 gigahertz) throughout the launch and\n    cruise stages. Continuous and instantaneous  communication with the\n    spacecraft was maintained throughout the launch phase, switching to\n    communication every three days in the cruise phase.  All X-band\n    capability was lost once the cruise  stage was jettisoned. During the\n    surface mission, the landed Helix antenna on the Lander deck\n    communicated with DSN via the orbiters Mars Express (MRO), Mars\n    Odyssey (ODY), and Mars Express  (MEX) every four to eight hours.\n \n    Other Lander systems included a single RAD6000 processor, a fault\n    detection and correction  system for monitoring spacecraft health, a\n    guidance system to land the spacecraft, a propulsion  system for\n    touchdown, a data handling system for committing critical data to\n    overnight storage during  surface operations, and a heater system to\n    ensure the spacecraft maintained an appropriate  temperature . The\n    Lander served as a host for various associated instrumentation,\n    including six  instrument packages: the Surface Stereo Imager (SSI),\n    Robotic Arm (RA) and associated Icy Soil  Acquisition Device (ISAD),\n    the Robotic Arm Camera (RAC), the Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and\n    Conductivity Analyzer (MECA), the Thermal Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA),\n    and the Meteorological  Package (MET) [SMITHETAL2008].\n \n    During most of Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), Phoenix used a UHF\n    antenna that wrapped around  the backshell to give it a wide field of\n    view (FOV) for  communications. During terminal descent (approximately\n    30 seconds before landing), the Lander switched to the landed Helix\n    antenna  and continued transmitting a UHF signal until one minute\n    after  landing. This wide FOV was  necessary as the geometry between\n    Phoenix and the orbiters MRO, ODY, and MEX  required a very wide\n    spread of off-boresight angles.\n \n    Following its soft touchdown between 65 deg N to 72 deg N latitude,\n    and after waiting 20 minutes for the dust to settle, the Lander\n    performed a number of critical activities. These 'Sol 0' (a sol is  a\n    mars day) activities included deployments of the landed solar  arrays,\n    the bio-barrier covering the RA, and the SSI and MET  masts. The SSI\n    took images of the bio-barrier, solar arrays,  and part of the footpad\n    and workspace. High priority EDL and Sol  0 data were saved to flash\n    memory within the first hour after  touchdown, after which the Lander\n    went to sleep to conserve  energy. The Lander woke up for 10 minutes\n    for the first  post-landed UHF communication pass one ODY or MRO orbit\n    period  (approximately 2 hours) after landing. After relaying data to\n    the orbiters during that first pass, the  Lander went to sleep again.\n    Payload heaters were on  continuously from touchdown, with Lander\n    heaters kicking in  around midnight for 4-5 hours of keep-alive\n    heating.  [GUINNETAL2008]\n \n  Lander on the Surface of Mars\n  =============================\n    The first seven sols after Landing were known as the  characterization\n    phase, with pre-planned activities running from  a minimum of 3 hours\n    on Sol 1 to a maximum of 6.5 hours on Sol 6  (the Lander was active\n    for up to 7 hours during the nominal surface  or digging phase). The\n    performance of the spacecraft's power, thermal, and UHF subsystems\n    were thoroughly characterized during  this phase, and TEGA, MECA, and\n    MET instruments went through their initial checkouts and  prepared for\n    nominal operations. Concurrent with  these activities, the EDL and Sol\n    0 data that were stored in the  non-volatile (flash memory) were\n    relayed to the ground. The SSI  imaged as much of the Lander as it\n    could see and characterized  the workspace and surrounding\n    environment. The  RAC located on the 'wrist' of the RA was  used to\n    image the footpads and the TEGA cover, as it was the only  imager that\n    could be maneuvered into the proper viewpoint for these  pictures.\n \n    After the Robotic Arm (RA) was checked out, the digging phase\n    commenced. The digging phase activities included digging a trench  in\n    front of the Lander, and the analysis of soil samples at  various\n    trench-depths by the Lander instruments. This phase  continued until\n    the End-of-Mission on Sol 90. Operations during  this phase were\n    conducted at the University of Arizona.\n \n    The Lander operated for 152 sols and achieved all scientific\n    objectives.\n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n    by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n    Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n    Administration (NASA).\n \n    The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n    communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n    solar system.  To carry out this function it is equipped with\n    high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,\n    and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n    The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n    equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at\n    Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,\n    Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of\n    the complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the\n    third is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n    Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their\n    diameters, construction, or operational characteristics:\n    70-m diameter, standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m\n    diameter (HEF), and 34-m beam waveguide (BWG).\n \n    For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].\n \n  Instrument Host Overview - 2001 Mars Odyssey\n  ============================================\n    The 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY) spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin\n    Astronautics (LMA).  Most spacecraft systems were redundant\n    in order to provide backup should a device fail.  In addition\n    to transmitting data collected by ODY instruments and systems,\n    the telecommunications system was used to relay data from Mars\n    surface assets and measure their relative motion radiometrically\n    in the 400 MHz frequency range.

Both spacecraft operated from 1976 through\n      April 1980 and Viking Lander 1 (VL1) continued to operate until\n      November 1982.  In 1981, Viking Lander 1 was renamed the Thomas\n      A.  Mutch Memorial Station in honor of Tim Mutch, Lander\n      Imaging Team Leader and later NASA Associate Administrator for\n      Space Sciences.  Tim Mutch was killed in a climbing accident in\n      1980.\n \n      The Viking Landers were identical to each other and had the\n      same instrument packages.  The main lander structure was a\n      hexagonal prism body that housed the spacecraft computers, tape\n      recorder, batteries, several science instruments, and controls\n      for the surface sampler, thermal system, and data handling\n      system.  The spacecraft body was supported above the surface by\n      three legs, each with a curved footpad.  The legs were arranged\n      in a triangle pattern with two at the front of the lander and\n      one at the rear.  Mounted to the sides of the spacecraft were\n      three terminal descent engines, two propellant tanks, and the\n      extendible surface sampler arm and collector head.

	"display_description": "Mars Observer was launched September 25, 1992 from Cape Canaveral\n    on a Titan III built by Martin Marietta Corporation, with an\n    upper Transfer Orbit Stage from Orbital Sciences Corporation.\n    Flight controllers lost contact with the spacecraft on August\n    21, 1993, effectively terminating the mission.\n \n    For most Mars Observer experiments, data were to be collected by\n    instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then to be\n    relayed via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep\n    Space Network (DSN) on the ground.  Radio Science experiments\n    (such as radio tracking of the spacecraft and bistatic radio\n    scattering experiments) required that DSN hardware also\n    participate in data acquisition.  The following sections provide\n    an overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground\n    system as both supported Mars Observer science activities.\n \n    Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n    =====================================\n \n      The Mars Observer spacecraft provided a stabilized,\n      nadir-oriented platform for continuous observations of Mars by\n      an advanced set of science instruments.However, communication\n      with the spacecraft was lost three days before it was scheduled\n      to enter Mars orbit in late August 1993.  Only data from\n      Earth-Mars cruise and a very small amount of distant-encounter\n      Mars data were obtained from Mars Observer.\n \n      The spacecraft contract was originally won by the RCA\n      Astro-Space Division (ASD), which subsequently became the\n      General Electric Astro-Space Division when the two companies\n      merged.  The selection of RCA was intended to make maximum use\n      of existing designs and technologies from DMSP/TIROS weather\n      satellites and Satcom-K communication satellites.  General\n      Electric sold ASD to Martin Marietta Corporation at about the\n      time Mars Observer was launched; Martin Marietta was the prime\n      contractor when the spacecraft was lost.\n \n      The dimensions of the rectangular bus were 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.1 m in\n      the x-y-z dimensions.  When fully deployed, the six-panel solar\n      array was 7.0 x 3.7 meters, and would have developed over a\n      kilowatt of power at Mars.  The mass of the spacecraft was\n      about 1028 kg, including 166 kg of payload but excluding the\n      approximately 1346 kg of propellant required, most of which was\n      intended for orbit insertion and orbit circularization at Mars.\n      The propellant also included 63 kg of hydrazine, which would\n      have been used for spacecraft control during mapping.\n \n      At launch (25 September 1992), the solar panels and high-gain\n      antenna were folded against the rectangular bus and the two\n      science booms (Magnetometer and Gamma-Ray Spectrometer) were\n      retracted.  During early cruise the partially-deployed\n      spacecraft was stabilized in a controlled 0.01-rpm roll about\n      the y-axis; communications were conducted with Earth via a\n      low-gain antenna.  For trajectory correction and orbit\n      insertion maneuvers the spacecraft was oriented under three-\n      axis control and then returned to cruise attitude.\n \n      In its mapping orbit, Mars Observer was to be controlled in\n      three axes, using its horizon sensors to point the science\n      instruments on the +Z face toward the nadir.  The six-panel\n      solar-array was to be fully deployed on a boom to track the Sun\n      during each orbit, and the high-gain antenna boom was to be\n      fully deployed to track the Earth around each orbit.\n \n      Spacecraft pointing control was provided by four reaction\n      wheels.  Attitude information during mapping was to be provided\n      by a Mars horizon sensor that defined the nadir direction, a\n      star-mapper for inertial attitude, gyros and accelerometers for\n      measuring angular rates and linear accelerations, and multiple\n      sun sensors.  The spacecraft was required to maintain adequate\n      pointing control and to provide sufficient telemetry to allow\n      reconstruction of the pointing after each orbit.  The telemetry\n      stream provided data from the sensors sufficient to\n      characterize nadir and high-gain antenna pointing to within +/-\n      3 mrad (per axis, 3 sigma) and boom-mounted science instrument\n      pointing to within +/- 25 mrad (per axis, 3 sigma).\n \n      Two independent propulsion systems were provided.  All major\n      maneuvers, both in cruise and during orbit insertion, were to\n      be accomplished by a hypergolic, bipropellant system.  A\n      hydrazine system was available for orbit trim maneuvers during\n      the mapping period and some attitude control functions,\n      including unloading of the momentum wheels.  The hydrazine\n      thrusters were chosen to minimize contamination of the\n      instruments during the mapping period.\n \n      Most instruments were rigidly mounted on a nadir-pointing\n      spacecraft panel and, in general, provided simultaneous views\n      of the same nadir area.  No movable scan platform was provided;\n      the spacecraft was to be continuously pointed toward nadir,\n      rotating at the orbital rate.  Those instruments that required\n      scanning or multiple fields of view were constructed with\n      internal scanning mechanisms.  The Gamma Ray Spectrometer and\n      Magnetometer sensor assemblies were mounted on individual booms\n      on the spacecraft.  The steerable high-gain antenna (used for\n      radio science) was mounted on a third boom.\n \n      For more information regarding the Mars Observer spacecraft,\n      see [ALBEE&PALLUCONI1990]\n \n \n    Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n    ==============================\n      The Mars Observer Radio Science investigations utilized\n      instrumentation with elements both on the spacecraft and at the\n      NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this is shared\n      equipment, being used for routine telecommunications as well as\n      for Radio Science.\n \n      The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n      by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n      Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n      Administration.\n \n      The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n      communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n      solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN is equipped\n      with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and\n      receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n      The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n      equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at\n      Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,\n      Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the\n      complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the\n      third is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n      The network comprises four subnets, each of which includes one\n      antenna at each complex.  The four subnets are defined\n      according to the properties of their respective antennas: 70-m\n      diameter, standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m\n      diameter, and 26-m diameter.\n \n      These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications\n      subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft, constitute the major\n      elements of instrumentation for radio science investigations.\n \n      For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].",

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n    ========================\n      For most Mars Global Surveyor experiments, data were collected\n      by instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed\n      via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space\n      Network (DSN) on the ground.  Radio Science experiments (such\n      as radio occultations) required that DSN hardware also\n      participate in data acquisition.  The following sections\n      provide an overview first of the spacecraft and then of the\n      DSN ground system as both supported Mars Global Surveyor\n      science activities.\n \n \n    Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n    =====================================\n      The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft was built by\n      Lockheed Martin Astronautics (LMA).  The spacecraft structure\n      included four subassemblies: the equipment module, the\n      propulsion module, the solar array support structure, and the\n      high-gain antenna (HGA) support structure.\n \n      The equipment module housed the avionics packages and science\n      instruments.  Its dimensions were 1.221 x 1.221 x 0.762 meters\n      in X, Y, and Z, respectively.  With the exception of the\n      Magnetometer, all of the science instruments were bolted to\n      the nadir equipment deck, mounted above the equipment module on\n      the +Z panel.  The Mars Relay antenna was the tallest\n      instrument rising 1.115 meters above the nadir equipment deck.\n \n      Inside, two identical computers orchestrated almost all of\n      the spacecraft's flight activities.  Although only one of the\n      two units controlled Surveyor at any one time, identical\n      software ran concurrently in the backup unit in case of an\n      emergency.  Each computer consisted of a Marconi 1750A\n      microprocessor, 128 Kbytes of RAM for storage, and 20 Kbytes\n      of ROM that contained code to run basic survival routines in\n      the event that the computers experienced a reset.\n \n      Additional storage for science and spacecraft health data\n      was provided by two solid-state recorders with a combined\n      capacity of 375 megabytes.  Mars Global Surveyor was NASA's\n      first planetary spacecraft to use RAM exclusively (instead of\n      a tape recorder) for mass data storage.  This technological\n      improvement reduced operational complexity and cost.\n \n      The equipment module also housed three 'reaction wheels'\n      mounted at right angles to each other.  By transferring angular\n      momentum to and from the rapidly spinning reaction wheels, MGS\n      flight computers could control the spacecraft attitude to high\n      precision.  A fourth reaction wheel, mounted in a direction\n      skewed to the other three, provided redundancy and backup.\n \n      Sun sensors were placed at several locations about the\n      spacecraft.  They provided basic information on spacecraft\n      attitude -- namely, a rough vector toward the Sun.  Their\n      primary use was during attitude reinitialization after a\n      spacecraft anomaly.\n \n      The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) contained gyroscopes\n      and accelerometers to measure angular rates and linear\n      accelerations.  Angular rate measurements were used to\n      determine yaw attitude during the Mapping Phase.  The IMU\n      also provided inertial attitude control, as might be\n      required during maneuvers.\n \n      The Mars Horizon Sensor Assembly (MHSA) determined the horizon\n      as seen from the spacecraft; from this, an empirical nadir\n      could be derived for pointing the science instruments.  The\n      MHSA was mounted to the +Z panel of the equipment module, next\n      to the science instruments.\n \n      The Celestial Sensor Assembly (CSA) complemented the IMU by\n      providing attitude data based on determination of positions\n      of known stars.  It was used during the Cruise Phase and Orbit\n      Insertion Phase for both attitude determination and control.\n      It was also used when precise attitude knowledge was required\n      during the Mapping Phase.  The CSA was mounted to the +Z panel\n      of the equipment module, next to the science instruments.\n \n      The propulsion module contained the propellant tanks, main\n      engines, propulsion feed system and attitude control\n      thrusters.  It was a rectangular box 1.063 meters on a side\n      and was bolted to the equipment module on the latter's -Z\n      panel.  The propulsion module also served as the adaptor to\n      the launch vehicle.\n \n      Propulsion was provided by a dual mode bi-propellant system\n      using nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and hydrazine.  This dual mode\n      differed from conventional bi-propellant systems in that the\n      hydrazine was used by both the main engine and the attitude\n      control thrusters, rather than having separate hydrazine\n      tanks for each.  The main engine was the only one that used\n      the bi-propellant system.  The main engine maximum thrust\n      was 659 N.  It was used for major maneuvers including large\n      trajectory corrections during Cruise, Mars orbit injection\n      (MOI), and transfer to the Mapping orbit (TMO).\n \n      Four rocket engine modules (REM), each containing three 4.45 N\n      thrusters, were provided.  Each REM contained two aft-facing\n      thrusters and one roll control thruster.  Four of the eight\n      aft-facing thrusters were used for the smaller trajectory\n      corrections during Cruise and for Orbit Trim Maneuvers (OTM)\n      during Mapping; they could also be used for attitude control\n      during main engine burns.  Two sets of four thrusters were on\n      redundant strings so that one string could be isolated in the\n      event of a failure.  Four thrusters were provided for\n      attitude control.  In addition to their role during maneuvers,\n      the 4.45 N thrusters were also used for momentum management.\n \n      MGS carried about 385 kg of propellant; nearly 75 percent of\n      that was used during MOI.\n \n      Two solar arrays, each 3.53 meters long by 1.85 meters wide\n      provided power.  Each array was mounted close to the top of\n      the propulsion module on the +Y and -Y panels and near the\n      interface between the propulsion and equipment modules.\n      Including the adaptor that held the array to the propulsion\n      module, the tip of each array was designed to stand 4.270\n      meters from the side of the spacecraft.  During initial\n      deployment, the -Y solar array yoke was damaged leaving its\n      exact position and orientation in some doubt (and leading to\n      several changes in mission design).  Rectangular, metal\n      'drag flaps' were mounted to the end of each array; these\n      flaps increased the total surface area of the structure and\n      added another 0.813 meters to the overall dimensions.\n      Between each array and flap was mounted a magnetometer sensor.\n \n      Each array consisted of two panels, an inner and outer panel,\n      comprised of gallium arsenide and silicon solar cells,\n      respectively.  During mapping operations at Mars, the amount\n      of power produced by the arrays varied from a high of 980\n      Watts at perihelion to a low of 660 Watts at aphelion.\n \n      While in orbit around Mars, the solar arrays provided\n      power as MGS flew over the day side of the planet.  When\n      the spacecraft passed over the night side, energy flowed\n      from two nickel-hydrogen (NiH2) batteries, each with a\n      capacity of about 20 Amp-hours.  Eclipses lasted from 36 to\n      41 minutes per orbit; depth of battery discharge was limited\n      to 27% except during emergencies.\n \n      The high-gain antenna structure was also bolted to the\n      outside of the propulsion module.  When fully deployed, the\n      1.5-meter diameter antenna sat at the end of a 2-meter boom\n      which was mounted to the +X panel of the propulsion module.\n      Two rotating joints (gimbals) held the antenna to the boom\n      and allowed the antenna to track and point at Earth while\n      the science instruments observed Mars.\n \n      One of the two main functions of the HGA was to receive\n      command sequences sent by the flight operations\n      team on Earth.  During command periods, data flowed to MGS\n      at rates in multiples of two from 7.8125 bits per second\n      (emergency rate) to 500 bits per second (750 commands per\n      minute); the nominal rate was 125 bits per second.\n \n      The other main function of the HGA was to send data back\n      to Earth.  All transmissions from MGS utilized an X-band\n      radio link near 8.4 gigahertz.  The transmitted power was\n      about 25 watts.  Data rates as high as 85333 bits per second\n      were used.\n \n      The spacecraft was also equipped with four low-gain antennas\n      (LGA), two for transmit and two for receive.  The LGAs were\n      used in Inner Cruise, during special events such as maneuvers,\n      during aerobraking, and for emergency communications following\n      a spacecraft anomaly.\n \n      The primary transmitting low-gain antenna (LGT1) was mounted\n      on the traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) enclosure, which\n      was mounted on the rim of the HGA reflector; its boresight\n      was aligned with the HGA boresight, which was in the +X\n      direction until HGA deployment.  The backup (LGT2) was also\n      mounted on the TWTA enclosure.  LGT2 boresight was aligned\n      at a cant angle approximately 160 degrees away from the\n      shared boresights of the HGA and LGT1.  This angle was chosen\n      to minimize the consequences of a gimbal failure once\n      articulation commenced after deployment of the HGA boom in\n      mapping orbit.  LGT2 was not used prior to HGA deployment\n      because its orientation and proximity to the nadir payload\n      deck would lead to irradiation of the payload instruments\n      while the HGA was in its stowed position.  One receiving LGA\n      (LGR) was mounted on the -X panel of the equipment module;\n      the other was on the +X side of the propulsion module.\n \n      The spacecraft was equipped with an experimental Ka-band\n      downlink radio system.  The transmitter converted the X-band\n      signal to 32 Ghz and amplified it to about 0.5 watts; the\n      Ka-band output was radiated through the HGA.\n \n      The spacecraft +Z axis vector was normal to the nadir equipment\n      deck; the main engine was aimed in the -Z direction.  The -X\n      axis vector was in the direction of the velocity vector during\n      nominal Mapping (e.g., May 1999).  +X was in the direction of\n      the HGA boresight during Cruise, and the HGA boom was mounted to\n      the +X panel of the propulsion module.  The +Y axis completed an\n      orthogonal rectangular coordinate system.  The +/-Y axes defined\n      generally the deployment directions of the solar panels.  The\n      solar cells themselves were on the -Z sides of the panels.\n \n      There were three levels of anomaly response in the spacecraft\n      flight software.  The first, emergency mode, was entered in\n      response to a command-loss timeout.  Entry into emergency mode\n      reconfigured the telecom subsystem to its lowest data rate\n      settings to enhance the chances of successful contact from\n      Earth.  After a programmable period of time in emergency mode,\n      the spacecraft transitioneds to contingency mode.\n \n      Contingency mode was entered by four paths: failure to regain\n      contact with Earth while in emergency mode, power-related faults\n      such as gimbal faults and low battery state of charge, loss of\n      inertial reference, and explicit ground command.  Contingency\n      mode sets telecom rates to their minimum values, turneds off\n      non-essential power loads (including the payload), disableds\n      stored sequences not explicitly specified as enabled for this\n      mode, and changeds the spacecraft attitude to sun-coning to\n      optimize power and communications.\n \n      Safe mode was the deepest level of anomaly response.  It couldan be\n      be entered by three paths: failures of key spacecraft components\n      that could cannot be corrected by normal fault protection, power-on\n      reset of both Spacecraft Control Processors (SCPs), or explicit\n      ground command.  The response to safe mode entry was similar to\n      that of contingency mode.  Safe mode program code for the SCP was\n      executed from Programmable Read-Only-Memory (PROM).\n \n      For more information on the spacecraft and mission see\n      [JPLD-12088].\n \n \n    Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n    ==============================\n      The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n      by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n      Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n      Administration (NASA).\n \n      The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n      communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n      solar system.

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n  =====================================\n \n    Launch Vehicle Description\n    --------------------------\n      The launch vehicle used for Mars Pathfinder was the McDonnell\n      Douglas Delta II 7925.  An engine section in the Delta first\n      stage housed the Rocketdyne RS-27 main engine and two\n      Rocketdyne LR101-NA-11 vernier engines.  The vernier engines\n      provided roll control during main engine burn, and attitude\n      control after main engine cutoff and before second stage\n      separation.  The RS-27 main engine was a single start, liquid\n      bi-propellant rocket engine which provided approximately\n      894,094 N of thrust at lift off.  The first stage propellant\n      load (96,000 kg) consisted of RP-1 fuel (thermally stable\n      kerosene) and liquid oxygen as an oxidizer.  The RP-1 fuel tank\n      and liquid oxygen tank were separated by a center body section\n      that housed control electronics, ordnance sequencing equipment,\n      a telemetry system, and a rate gyro.  First stage thrust\n      augmentation was provided by nine solid-propellant Graphite\n      Epoxy Motors (GEMs), each fueled with 12,000 kg of\n      hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene solid propellant.  Each GEM\n      provided an average thrust of 439,796 N at lift off.  The main\n      engine, vernier engines, and six of the GEMs were ignited at\n      lift off.  The remaining three GEMs were ignited in flight.\n      The GEMs were jettisoned from the first stage after motor\n      burnout.\n \n      The interstage assembly extended from the top of the first\n      stage to the second stage mini-skirt.  This assembly carried\n      loads to the first stage, and contained an exhaust vent and six\n      spring driven separation rods.\n \n      The Delta II 7925 second stage propulsion system included a\n      restartable, liquid bi-propellant Aerojet AJ10-118K engine that\n      consumed Aerozine 50 fuel (a 50/50 mix of hydrazine and\n      asymmetric dimethyl hydrazine) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4).\n      Since Aerozine 50 and nitrogen tetroxide are hypergolic, no\n      catalyst or igniter in the engine thrust chamber was required.\n      The second stage had a total propellant load of 6000 kg and\n      provided a thrust of 42,000 N.  Gaseous helium was used for\n      pressurization, and a nitrogen cold gas jet system provided\n      attitude control during coast periods and roll control during\n      powered flight.  Hydraulically activated gimbals provided pitch\n      and yaw control.  The forward section of the second stage\n      housed the guidance and control equipment that provided\n      guidance sequencing and stabilization signals for both the\n      first and second stages.  Both first and second stages had a\n      battery driven DC power system.  Separate batteries were used\n      for the guidance and control system, ordnance, and engine\n      systems.  The instrumentation and flight termination system\n      were powered by the same battery.\n \n      The Payload Assist Module D (PAM-D) was the third stage of the\n      Delta II 7925 launch vehicle and provided the final velocity\n      required to place the Pathfinder spacecraft on a trajectory to\n      Mars.  The PAM-D upper stage consisted of (1) a spin table to\n      support, rotate, and stabilize the Pathfinder spacecraft /\n      PAM-D combination before separating from the second stage, (2)\n      a Star-48B solid rocket motor for propulsion, (3) an active\n      Nutation Control System (NCS) to provide stability after\n      spin-up of the spacecraft/PAM-D stack, (4) a 3717C payload\n      attach fitting to mount the Star-48B motor to the spacecraft,\n      and (5) a yo-yo de-spin system designed to decrease the spin\n      rate of the upper stage / spacecraft stack from 70 RPM to 12\n      +/- 2 RPM.  The Star-48B provided an average thrust of 67,168 N\n      and was fueled with 2000 kg of solid propellant that was\n      composed primarily of ammonium perchlorate and aluminum.\n \n      During launch and ascent through the sensible atmosphere, the\n      Pathfinder spacecraft / PAM-D upper stage combination was\n      protected from aerodynamic forces by a 2.9 m diameter payload\n      fairing.  The payload fairing was jettisoned from the launch\n      vehicle during second stage powered flight at a minimum\n      altitude of 111 km.\n \n \n    Flight System Description\n    -------------------------\n      The Mars Pathfinder Flight System consisted of six major\n      subsystems: Attitude and Information Management (AIM);\n      Telecommunications; Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL); Power\n      and Pyrotechnics; Propulsion; and Mechanical Structure.  Brief\n      descriptions of the subsystems are given below.\n \n \n    Mechanical Structure\n    --------------------\n      The Mars Pathfinder flight system was effectively three\n      spacecraft in one.  The flight system was a standard\n      interplanetary spacecraft in one mode, an atmospheric entry\n      vehicle in another, and a surface lander in the third.  The\n      major components of the spacecraft were the cruise stage, the\n      entry vehicle (consisting of the heatshield, backshell, and\n      attached hardware), and the lander (containing the rover).\n      Components from all other subsystems were distributed through\n      each of these elements.\n \n      The purpose of the lander was to provide engineering support to\n      the science instruments and rover during surface operations.\n      The landing approach employed by Mars Pathfinder required the\n      lander to have self righting capability.  A simple tetrahedron\n      design was developed to limit the possible landing\n      orientations.  The lander was able to right itself if it landed\n      on any face of the tetrahedron by driving actuators which\n      connected three faces of the tetrahedron (the petals) with the\n      fourth (the base petal).  All thermally sensitive electronics\n      were contained in the insulated Integrated Support Assembly\n      (ISA) located inside the tetrahedron.  This enclosure provided\n      a controlled environment to minimize the effects of the extreme\n      temperature variations on Mars.  The lander high gain antenna\n      and low gain antenna were attached to the outside of the ISA,\n      as was the Imager for Mars Pathfinder.  The rover was attached\n      to one of the side petals.\n \n      A detailed description of the entry vehicle is given in the\n      following EDL subsystem description.  The cruise stage was\n      responsible for controlling the vehicle during cruise, and was\n      home to most of the components required for interplanetary\n      flight.  These included launch vehicle separation devices;\n      attitude sensors; propulsive thrusters, tanks, and other\n      equipment; cruise antennas; and solar arrays.  The cruise stage\n      was jettisoned prior to entry into the Martian atmosphere and\n      impacted the surface.  To eliminate duplication of\n      capabilities, cruise stage hardware utilized key\n      telecommunications, attitude and information management\n      services, and power support from equipment that resided on the\n      lander.  As a result, there was a significant umbilical\n      extending between the lander and cruise stage.\n \n \n    Entry, Descent, and Landing Subsystem\n    -------------------------------------\n      The Entry, Descent, and Landing subsystem was responsible for\n      safely placing the lander on the surface of Mars.  In order to\n      do this, the velocity had to be reduced from the initial entry\n      velocity of 7.6 km/s to a level that limited the maximum\n      landing shock to less than 40 g's.  Specific components of the\n      system required to do this included a 2.65 meter diameter\n      aeroshell, accelerometers, a parachute, an incremental bridle,\n      retrorockets, airbags, and a radar altimeter.\n \n      The aeroshell was used to reduce the velocity of the vehicle\n      from 7.6 km/s to .370 km/s, removing over 99% of the initial\n      kinetic energy and protecting the lander against the resultant\n      extreme aerodynamic heating.  The heatshield was a\n      Viking-heritage, 70 degree half angle blunt cone.  Thermal\n      protection was provided by Viking-heritage SLA-561V ablative\n      material.  Ablative material was also applied to the backshell\n      to protect the lander from the effects of recirculation flow\n      around the entry vehicle.  During the entry and descent phases,\n      accelerometers on the lander provided parachute deployment\n      timing information and acceleration data.  A 12.7 meter\n      diameter Viking heritage disk-gap-band parachute was used for\n      terminal descent.  The parachute was designed to open at\n      supersonic speeds with a maximum deployment dynamic pressure of\n      700 N/m^2.\n \n      The EDL system also included separation devices designed to\n      separate the heatshield from the backshell after parachute\n      deployment.  The heatshield had to be separated and released\n      from the backshell so that the lander could be deployed on the\n      incremental bridle.  The incremental bridle was designed to\n      provide separation between the backshell-mounted retrorockets\n      and the lander and to improve stability during the rocket\n      firing.  A radar altimeter on the lander was used to determine\n      when to ignite the three retrorockets.  The retrorockets were\n      sized to bring the backshell/lander system to a complete stop\n      at approximately 15 m above the surface.  Four airbags attached\n      to the faces of the tetrahedral lander were inflated just\n      before the rockets fired and were designed to limit landing\n      loads to less than 40 Earth g's.  The airbags were inflated\n      using three gas generators in 1/4 of a second.  The generators\n      continued to maintain the pressure in the airbags for over one\n      minute past initial pressurization.  Just prior to contacting\n      the surface, cable cutters released the lander from the\n      parachute, backshell, and retrorockets.  The lander hit with a\n      vertical velocity of 12 m/s and a horizontal velocity of 6 m/s.\n      After ground impact and tumbling, the airbags deflated and were\n      retracted.  The three lander petals were then opened to\n      establish an upright configuration on the surface.\n \n      All of the details of the timing for the entire EDL procedure\n      were determined in real time on board the spacecraft.\n \n \n    Attitude and Information Management Subsystem\n    ---------------------------------------------\n      The AIM subsystem performed all spacecraft computing functions\n      including command and telemetry handling, HGA pointing, payload\n      data compression, cruise attitude determination and control,\n      and EDL timing.  This subsystem was built around a single\n      high-performance (20 MIPS), 32-bit, single-board R6000\n      computer.  The computer had 128 Mbyte of dynamic RAM for flight\n      software, engineering measurements, and science data.  An\n      additional 4 Mbytes of electronically erasable PROM was\n      included to hold flight software boot code, critical sequences\n      and data.  The speed and capabilities of this computer greatly\n      simplified both software development and mission operations.\n \n      Internal interfaces within AIM were implemented using a VME bus\n      backplane.  Major VME interfaces included the Power &\n      Pyrotechnics subsystem, the Reed Solomon downlink board, the\n      hardware command decoder, and the power converter unit.  A\n      Mil-Std-1553 bus served for engineering data links to remote\n      engineering units which collected status data from the\n      celestial sensors and analog telemetry channels.  Celestial\n      sensors included a modified Magellan/IUS star scanner and a\n      five head sun sensor.  The spacecraft was spin stabilized\n      during cruise, and maintained an Earth point profile for most\n      of the flight (except for portions near Earth and Mars).  The\n      attitude determination and control system was required to\n      maintain at least 2 degrees inertial pointing throughout\n      cruise.  Attitude determination and HGA control was required\n      during the surface phase.  The autonomous pointing accuracy\n      requirement for the HGA was 3.5 degrees (note that more\n      accurate pointing was possible using downlink dithering).  The\n      AIM was also responsible for collecting and packetizing science\n      data from the instruments.\n \n      Flight software in the AIM controlled the uplink interface,\n      downlink telemetry, instrument control, engineering / science\n      data collection and formatting, bus control, sequence and\n      command processing, attitude determination / control, and power\n      / pyro functions.  The flight software design was coded in 'C'.\n      The operating system was an adaptation of VxWorks, a\n      commercially-available operating system for the R6000 computer.\n      The operating system provided a file system and an interprocess\n      communications protocol for flight software components.\n \n \n    Telecommunications Subsystem\n    ----------------------------\n      The Telecommunications subsystem provided communications\n      capability during cruise, EDL and surface operations and\n      support for radio navigation during cruise.  The baseline\n      design was a direct to Earth X-band system.  There were two\n      major elements to this subsystem: the Radio Frequency Subsystem\n      (RFS) and the Antenna Subsystem.  All RFS components were\n      located in the lander ISA.  Primary RFS functions were\n      performed by a single string Cassini transponder, a 13 watt\n      (RF) Solid State Power Amplifier, a newly developed Telemetry\n      Modulation Unit, and a Cassini Command Decoder Unit.  This\n      single string approach was designed to work for the duration of\n      the short Pathfinder mission, however, a partially redundant\n      backup downlink capability was also provided.  This backup\n      system included a small X-band transmitter with an integrated 5\n      W (RF) power amplifier and an additional TMU.  This backup\n      provided significantly less performance than the primary\n      system, but was designed to be sufficient to satisfy the\n      primary mission objectives in an emergency.\n \n      The Antenna Subsystem consisted of five antennas for cruise,\n      EDL and surface operations.  A waveguide connected the RFS in\n      the lander to a medium gain antenna (MGA) located on the cruise\n      stage.  A medium gain antenna was required to maintain a\n      minimum 20 b/s link through cruise.  The MGA was a standard\n      Mars Observer design.  Two antennas were provided for EDL\n      communications.  The backshell LGA was used during entry and\n      early parachute descent.  The EDL LGA was a whip antenna\n      attached to the top of the lander and was used during the final\n      portion of parachute descent.  Two antennas were provided on\n      the lander.  The principal antenna was a steerable high gain\n      antenna mounted on the ISA.  The HGA was a mechanically-steered\n      slotted plate with 2 degrees of freedom in pointing.  It\n      provided a nominal 125 b/s command uplink rate and a telemetry\n      downlink rate of approximately 600 b/s into a DSN 34-m antenna\n      (or 2700 b/s into a 70-m antenna).  These data rate\n      capabilities assumed 3.5 degrees pointing of the HGA.  Improved\n      pointing (using a dithering scheme with the DSN) could improve\n      these rates.  These rates were also conservative in that they\n      contained a 3 dB link margin.  A Low Gain Antenna was provided\n      for emergency situations in the event the HGA should fail.  The\n      LGA provided an emergency 7.8 b/s command uplink rate and a\n      minimum 40 b/s downlink rate over a 60 degree beam width.\n \n \n    Power and Pyrotechnics Subsystem\n    --------------------------------\n      The Power and Pyrotechnics Subsystem was responsible for\n      generating, storing and distributing power during cruise and\n      surface operations.  In addition, this subsystem was\n      responsible for controlling and initiating all pyrotechnic\n      devices required for EDL and surface operations.  Power was\n      generated during cruise by a 4.4 m^2 Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)\n      solar array which covered the top surface of the cruise stage.\n      The 5.5 mm thick cells were arranged to prevent any single\n      failures from catastrophically impacting the power output.\n      Power was generated on the surface by 2.9 m^2 of GaAs solar\n      arrays mounted on the exposed surfaces of the lander petals.\n      The lander and cruise stage used the same 5.5 mm thick cells.\n \n      A 40 amp-hr (~1120 W-hr @ 28 V) silver zinc battery was used to\n      provide energy storage during the mission.  Silver zinc\n      batteries are typically used in primary battery applications\n      (like launch vehicles), but Pathfinder re-qualified the\n      technology for use as a rechargeable battery.  The advantage of\n      this type of battery is a much higher energy density than\n      typical NiCd or NiH batteries.  The disadvantage is a\n      relatively short cycle life (limited to 30-100 cycles).  The\n      battery was only used to support launch, trajectory correction\n      maneuvers (TCMs) and surface operations, however, so the cycle\n      capability was sufficient for primary operations.\n \n      The power distribution system used an unregulated bus\n      controlled by a shunt regulator.  Pyro devices were initiated\n      using a secondary power distribution system (isolated from the\n      main) to prevent ground loop problems.  Because of the rapid\n      firing of pyros during EDL, special thermal batteries were\n      included as a backup power source for the pyro system.  The\n      pyro system was designed to provide sufficient arm and enable\n      controls to satisfy all system safety requirements.\n \n \n    Propulsion Subsystem\n    --------------------\n      The Propulsion subsystem included all equipment needed to\n      perform attitude control and TCM's during cruise and Rocket\n      Assisted Deceleration during EDL.  The cruise stage propulsion\n      system consisted of four blow-down hydrazine titanium\n      propellant tanks connected with eight 4.45 N (1 lb) thrusters\n      via series latch valves.  These thrusters were arranged to\n      allow coupled turns and both axial and transverse translational\n      maneuvers.  The purpose and function of the RAD rockets are\n      described more fully in the EDL section above.\n \n \n    Mass Summary\n    ------------\n      The spacecraft launch mass was 894 kg, including the hydrazine\n      (N2H4) propellant, science instruments, and a free-ranging\n      rover surface vehicle.  The required amount of propellant was\n      calculated using the maximum available spacecraft launch mass\n      of 905 kg.  The entry mass was 584 kg.  The entry mass was a\n      key driver on the EDL system design, so careful margin\n      management was important.\n \n \n    Spacecraft Summary\n    ------------------\n      Launch Mass:        894 kg (Includes Propellant)\n      Entry Mass:         584 kg\n      Lander Mass:        370 kg\n \n      Basic Design:\n         - Aeroshell, parachute, RAD rocket and airbag Entry, Descent,\n           and Landing (EDL) system\n         - Self righting, tetrahedral lander\n         - Active thermal design for cruise\n         - Free ranging rover\n \n      Command And Data Handling\n         - Integrated Attitude and Information Management System (AIM)\n \n      Computation\n         - R6000 Computer with VME bus, 22 Millions of Instructions Per\n           Second (MIPS), 128 Mbyte mass memory\n \n      Power\n         - Solar powered cruise stage and lander\n \n      Telemetry And Command\n         - Surface operations telemetry rate via High Gain Antenna (HGA),\n           X-Band: 6 kb/s to 70 m Deep Space Network\n         - Surface operations command rate via HGA, X-Band: 250 b/s\n \n      Propulsion\n         - Monopropellant hydrazine used for cruise\n         - Eight 4.4 N thrusters\n         - Total delta-v of 130 m/s\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    The Pathfinder radio telecommunications system was used to\n    monitor the distance between Earth and Pathfinder and its rate of\n    change in order to determine the rate of precession of Mars.\n    This utilized elements of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) in\n    addition to the instrumentation on board the spacecraft.\n \n    The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n    by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n    Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n    Administration.\n \n    The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n    communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n    solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN is equipped\n    with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,\n    and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n    The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n    equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at\n    Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,\n    Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the\n    complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the third\n    is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n    The network comprises four subnets, each of which includes one\n    antenna at each complex.  The four subnets are defined according\n    to the properties of their respective antennas: 70-m diameter,\n    standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter, and 26-m\n    diameter.\n \n    These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications\n    subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft, constitute the major\n    elements of instrumentation for radio science investigations.\n \n    For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].",

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    The Microrover Flight Experiment (MFEX), also known as the 'Mars\n    Pathfinder Rover' and 'Sojourner', is a NASA Office of Advanced\n    Concepts and Technology (OACT) flight experiment for autonomous\n    mobile vehicle technologies.  Its primary mission was to\n    determine microrover performance in the poorly understood\n    planetary terrain of Mars.  The microrover was delivered,\n    integrated with the Mars Pathfinder (MPF) Lander, to Mars on July\n    4, 1997.  After landing, the microrover was deployed from the\n    lander and began a nominal 7 sol mission, which was later\n    extended, to conduct technology experiments such as determining\n    wheel-soil interactions, autonomous navigation and hazard\n    avoidance capabilities, and engineering characterizations\n    (thermal control, power generation performance, etc.).  In\n    addition, the microrover carried an Alpha Proton X-ray\n    Spectrometer (APXS) which when deployed on rocks and soil\n    provided element composition.  Lastly, the microrover imaged the\n    lander to assist in status and damage assessment.\n \n \n    Mechanical, Thermal, and Mobility Subsystem\n    -------------------------------------------\n      The microrover is a 6-wheeled vehicle of a rocker bogie design\n      which allows the traverse of obstacles a wheel diameter (13 cm)\n      in size.  Each wheel is independently actuated and geared\n      (2000:1) providing superior climbing capability in soft sand.\n      The front and rear wheels are independently steerable,\n      providing the capability for the vehicle to turn in place.  The\n      vehicle has a top speed of 0.4 m/min.\n \n      Microrover components not designed to survive ambient Mars\n      temperatures (-110 degrees Celsius during a Martian night) are\n      contained in the warm electronics box (WEB).  The WEB is\n      insulated, coated with high and low emissivity paints, and\n      heated with a combination of 3, 1W RHUs, resistive heating\n      under computer control during the day and waste heat produced\n      by the electronics.  This design allows the WEB to maintain\n      components between -40 and +40 degrees Celsius during a Martian\n      day.\n \n \n      Control and Navigation Subsystem\n      --------------------------------- Control is provided by an\n      integrated set of computing and power distribution electronics.\n      The computer is an 80C85 rated at 100 Kips which uses, in a 16\n      Kbyte page swapping fashion, 176 Kbytes of PROM and 576 Kbytes\n      of RAM.  The computer performs I/O to some 70 sensor channels\n      and services such devices as the cameras, modem, motors and\n      experiment electronics.\n \n      Vehicle motion control is accomplished through the on/off\n      switching of the drive or steering motors.  An average of motor\n      encoder (drive) or potentiometer (steering) readings determines\n      when to switch off the motors.  When motors are off, the\n      computer conducts a proximity and hazard detection function,\n      using its laser striping and camera system to determine the\n      presence of obstacles in its path.  The vehicle is steered\n      autonomously to avoid obstacles but continues to achieve the\n      commanded goal location.  While stopped, the computer also\n      updates its measurement of distance traveled and heading using\n      the averaged odometry and on-board gyro.  This provides an\n      estimate of progress to the goal location.\n \n \n    Power Generation and Distribution\n    ---------------------------------\n      The microrover is powered by a 0.22 sqare meter solar panel\n      comprised of 13 strings of 18, 5.5 mil GaAs cells each.  The\n      solar panel is backed up by 9 LiSOCL2 D-cell sized primary\n      batteries, providing up to 150 W-hr.  This combined\n      panel/batteries system allows microrover power users to draw up\n      to 30W of peak power (mid-sol) while the peak panel production\n      is 16 W.  The normal driving power requirement for the\n      microrover is 10 W.\n \n \n    Radio Communications\n    --------------------\n      Command and telemetry is provided by modems on the microrover\n      and lander.  The microrover is the link commander of this 1/2\n      duplex, UHF system.  During the day, the microrover regularly\n      requests transmission of any commands sent from Earth and\n      stored on the lander.  When commands are not available, the\n      microrover transmits any telemetry collected during the last\n      interval between communication sessions.  The telemetry\n      received by the lander from the microrover is stored and\n      forwarded to the earth the same as any lander telemetry.  In\n      addition, this communication system is used to provide a\n      'heartbeat' signal during vehicle driving.  While stopped, the\n      microrover sends a signal to the lander.  Once acknowledged by\n      the lander, the microrover proceeds to the next stopping point\n      along its traverse.\n \n      Commands for the microrover are generated and analysis of\n      telemetry is performed at the microrover control station, a\n      Silicon Graphics workstation which is a part of the MPF ground\n      control operation.  At the end of each sol of microrover\n      traverse, the camera system on the lander takes a stereo image\n      of the vehicle in the terrain.  Those images, portions of a\n      terrain panorama and supporting images from the microrover\n      cameras, are displayed at the control station.  The operator is\n      able to designate on the display points in the terrain which\n      will serve as goal locations for the microrover traverse.  The\n      coordinates of these points are transferred into a file\n      containing the commands for execution by the microrover on the\n      next sol.  In addition, the operator can use a model which,\n      when overlayed on the image of the vehicle, measures the\n      location and heading of the vehicle.  This information is also\n      transfered into the command file to be sent to the microrover\n      on the next sol to correct any navigation errors.  This command\n      file is incorporated into the lander command stream and is sent\n      by the MPF ground control to the lander, earmarked for\n      transmission to the microrover upon request.\n \n      For more information on the Microrover Flight Experiment, see\n      the papers [MATIJEVIC1994] and [MATIJEVICETAL1997A].\n \n      Copyright 1996, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute\n      of Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space\n      Administration.",

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    For most Mars Odyssey experiments, data were collected by\n    instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed\n    via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space\n    Network (DSN) on the ground.  Radio Science observations (such\n    as radio tracking) required that DSN hardware also participate\n    in data acquisition.  The following sections provide an\n    overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground\n    system as both supported Mars Odyssey science activities.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n  =====================================\n    The Mars Odyssey spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin\n    Astronautics (LMA).  The spacecraft structure was divided into\n    two modules: the equipment module and the propulsion module.\n    The shape was not uniform, but can be approximated by\n    envisioning a box 2.2 x 1.7 x 2.6 meters.  The framework was\n    composed of aluminum and titanium.  Most spacecraft systems\n    were redundant in order to provide backup should a device fail.\n    For more information, see [JPLD-16303].\n \n    Command and Data Handling\n    -------------------------\n      This subsystem handled all computing functions for Mars\n      Odyssey.  It ran the flight software and controlled the\n      spacecraft through interface electronics.  The system was\n      based around a RAD6000 computer with 128 megabytes of\n      random access memory (RAM) and 3 megabytes non-volatile\n      memory, which allowed data to be maintained by the system\n      in the event of a power failure.  The interface\n      electronics were computer cards that communicated with\n      external peripherals.  The cards fit into the computer's\n      main board.  There were two identical sets of the\n      computer and interface electronics for back up in case\n      one failed.  One card was not redundant.  It was a one\n      gigabyte mass memory card that was used to store imaging\n      data.\n \n    Telecommunications\n    ------------------\n      The telecommunication subsystem was composed of two parts.\n      The first was a radio system that operated in the X-band\n      microwave frequency range.  It was used for communications\n      between Earth and the spacecraft.  The other system operated\n      in the ultra high frequency (UHF) range for communications\n      between future Mars landers and Odyssey.\n \n      Communication between the spacecraft and Earth occurred\n      through the use of three antennas.  The high-gain antenna was\n      a dish with 1.3 meter diameter (4.25 feet).  It was used\n      during the late Cruise and Science and relay phases of the\n      mission when data rates were high.  It simultaneously\n      received commands from Earth and transmitted science data to\n      Earth.  The medium-gain antenna was a 7.1 cm (2.8 inch) wide\n      rectangular horn antenna that protruded through the high-gain\n      dish.  The low-gain antenna was 4.4 cm (1.75 inches) and\n      provided wide- angle communications in emergencies or when\n      the high-gain antenna was not pointed directly at Earth.\n \n    Electrical Power\n    ----------------\n      A 7 square meter (75 square feet) solar panel containing an\n      array of gallium arsenide cells generated power for the\n      spacecraft.  The power distribution and drive unit sent power\n      to the electrical loads of the spacecraft through a system of\n      switches.\n \n    Guidance, Navigation and Control\n    --------------------------------\n      This subsystem used three redundant pairs of sensors to\n      determine the spacecraft's attitude.  A star camera was used\n      to look at star fields and a sun sensor detected the position\n      of the Sun in order to back up the star camera.  The inertial\n      measurement unit collected spacecraft orientation data\n      between star camera updates.  The reaction wheels along with\n      the thrusters operated to control the attitude.  There were\n      four reaction wheels - three primary and one for backup.\n      Odyssey was a three-axis stabilized spacecraft.\n \n    Propulsion\n    ----------\n      The propulsion system comprised a main engine, which aided in\n      placing Odyssey in orbit around Mars, and sets of small\n      thrusters, which performed attitude control and trajectory\n      correction maneuvers.  The main engine produced a thrust of\n      about 695 Newtons (156 pounds of force).  Each of the four\n      attitude controlling thrusters produced a thrust of 0.9\n      Newtons (0.2 pounds of force) and the four spacecraft turning\n      thrusters produced a force of 22 Newtons (5 pounds of force).\n      The propulsion system also included one gaseous helium tank\n      used to pressurize the fuel and oxidizer tanks, miscellaneous\n      tubing, pyro valves, and filters.\n \n    Structures\n    ----------\n      The spacecraft was composed of two modules - propulsion and\n      equipment.  The propulsion module contained tanks, thrusters,\n      and associated plumbing.  The equipment module consisted of\n      the equipment deck, which supported the Mars Radiation\n      Environment Experiment (MARIE), and engineering components.\n      The other component of the equipment module was the science\n      deck which housed the Thermal Emission Imaging System\n      (THEMIS), Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), High-Energy Neutron\n      Detector (HEND), Neutron Spectrometer (NS), and star cameras\n      on top and engineering components and the GRS central\n      electronics box on the underside.\n \n    Thermal Control\n    ---------------\n      A combination of heaters, radiators, louvers, blankets, and\n      thermal coatings maintained each spacecraft component's\n      temperature within its allowable limits.\n \n    Mechanisms\n    ----------\n      Odyssey functioned via several mechanisms, many of which were\n      associated with the high-gain antenna.  The antenna was\n      locked down during launch, cruise, and aerobraking through\n      three 'retention and release devices,' or latches.  The\n      antenna was released and deployed with a motor-driven hinge\n      once the science orbit around Mars was attained. A two-axis\n      gimbal assembly controlled the position of the antenna. The\n      solar array used four latches which folded together and\n      locked down the panels during launch.  After deployment, a\n      two-axis gimbal assembly controlled the solar array.  The\n      last mechanism was a latch for the deployment of the 6-meter\n      GRS boom.\n \n    Flight Software\n    ---------------\n      Odyssey received commands from Earth via radio and then\n      translated them into spacecraft actions. The flight software\n      had the capability to run many sequences concurrently in\n      addition to executing received commands immediately.\n \n      The data collection software was quite flexible.  The science\n      and engineering data were collected and then put in a variety\n      of holding bins called Application Identifiers (APIDs).  Ground\n      commands could easily modify the data routing and sampling\n      frequency.\n \n      A number of autonomous spacecraft performance functions were\n      part of the flight software.  The spacecraft ran routines\n      to control attitude and orientation without commands sent\n      from Earth.  The software also executed fault protection\n      routines to determine if any internal problem occurred.  If\n      a problem was found, a number of automatic preset actions\n      would occur to resolve the problem and put the spacecraft\n      into a standby mode until ground controllers provided\n      further direction.\n \n    Coordinate System\n    -----------------\n      The spacecraft frame is defined with the X axis parallel to\n      the stowed HGA boresight, the Y axis normal to the stowed\n      solar arrays, and the Z axis in the direction of the main\n      engine thrust (see figure below).  The origin of the frame\n      is centered on the launch vehicle separation plane.\n \n                                 _______________ HGA\n                                 \\             /\n              Science        ..   `._________.'\n               Orbit         || ._______________.\n             Velocity        || |       ^+Xsc   | Science Deck\n                ^.           || |       |       |\n                  `.         || |       |       |\n                    `.       || +Ysc    |       |\n                             ||@| <-----o +Zsc (out of page)\n                             || |               |\n                             || |               |\n                             || | Science Deck  |\n                      Solar  || ._______________.\n                      Array  ..\n \n                                   /\n                                  /\n                                 /\n                                V Nadir\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n    by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n    Technology for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space\n    Administration (NASA).\n \n    The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n    communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n    solar system.

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    For most Mars Exploration Rover (MER) experiments, data were\n    collected by instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then\n    relayed directly to stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN)\n    on Earth or indirectly using the Mars orbiters Mars Global Surveyor\n    (MGS) or 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY).  MER Radio Science observations\n    required that DSN and/or ODY hardware also participate in data\n    acquisition.  The following sections provide an overview first of\n    the MER spacecraft, then of the DSN ground system, and finally of\n    2001 Mars Odyssey as each supported MER science activities.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - Rover\n  ================================\n    The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission sent two identical\n    spacecraft to two different landing sites on Mars.  The hardware on\n    the first spacecraft is referred to as MER-2 (the rover named\n    Spirit which was sent to Gusev Crater), and the hardware on\n    the second spacecraft is referred to as MER-1 (the rover named\n    Opportunity sent to Meridiani Planum).  The spacecraft design owed a\n    lot of its heritage to the Mars Pathfinder configuration for cruise\n    and entry, descent, and landing.  For more detailed information on\n    the MER spacecraft, see [CRISPETAL2003].\n \n \n    Spacecraft Configuration for Entry, Descent, and Landing\n    --------------------------------------------------------\n      After separation from the cruise stage, the 840 kg entry vehicle\n      consisted of a backshell and heatshield enclosing the lander.  The\n      550 kg lander had a tetrahedral structure that the air bags were\n      deployed from and surrounded, and that housed the gas generators\n      for the airbags, the RADAR altimeter, motors for the unfolding of\n      the tetrahedron's four sides or 'petals,' and the rover lift\n      mechanism for standing up the rover.  On route to Mars, the rover\n      was stowed within the lander, and contained most of the power,\n      computing, and communication electronics for all phases of the\n      mission.  The backshell and heatshield provided thermal protection\n      from the hyperbolic entry into the Martian atmosphere through the\n      use of ablating materials.  Mounted inside the backshell was the\n      parachute, the deceleration and transverse impulse solid\n      rocket (TIRS) motors, a backshell inertial measurement unit, and\n      thermal batteries for the entry and descent phase.  The Entry,\n      Descent, and Landing camera was mounted on the lander radar\n      bracket.  The Descent Image Motion Estimation Subsystem (DIMES)\n      gathered the results of a real-time image correlation of surface\n      features contained in three successive Entry, Descent, and Landing\n      camera images of the Martian surface to compute the horizontal\n      velocity of the descending vehicle. TIRS used this horizontal\n      velocity measurement along with measurements of the attitude of\n      the backshell to compute a TIRS rocket firing solution.\n \n \n    Rover on the Surface of Mars\n    ----------------------------\n      After landing, the instrument host for each spacecraft is just the\n      rover itself, which is a 6-wheeled drive, 4-wheel-steered vehicle\n      180 kg in mass, including the science package.  At its wheel base,\n      the rover is approximately 141 cm long and 122 cm wide.  At the\n      height of the solar panel, the rover is approximately 225 cm wide\n      by 151 cm long.  In its deployed configuration with the Pancam\n      Mast Assembly (PMA) deployed, the rover is 154 cm tall.\n \n      The rocker bogie suspension system gave the rover the ability to\n      drive over obstacles approximately one wheel diameter (26 cm) in\n      size while providing a stable platform for instrument\n      measurements.  The distribution of mass of the vehicle allowed the\n      vehicle to be stable even at a 45 degree tilt.  Each wheel and\n      steering degree of freedom was independently actuated, which\n      allowed the vehicle to turn in place (turning diameter 1.9 m), to\n      skid steer to a tighter angle (turning diameter as small\n      as 0.9 m), to turn in gradual arcs, or to drag wheels that\n      effectively trench the Martian regolith.  When moving on flat\n      terrain, the vehicle could achieve a top speed of 5 cm/s.  Under\n      autonomous control using its hazard avoidance system, the rover\n      drove with an average speed of about 1 cm/sec.\n \n      The rover was powered by a combination of solar arrays and\n      rechargeable batteries.  The solar panel provides 30 strings of\n      triple junction cells (gallium indium phosphorus, gallium\n      arsenide, and germanium) covering 1.3 square meters, which\n      produced about 800 to 900 W hours per sol at the beginning of the\n      MER mission.  Each rover had two reference solar cells, one that\n      measures short circuit current and another that measures open\n      circuit voltage.  Due to the change in season from late southern\n      summer to early southern autumn, and the degradation in\n      performance due to dust deposition, the energy produced by this\n      array dropped to about 600 W h per sol, 90 sols after landing.\n      Energy was stored in two 8 A h lithium ion rechargeable batteries\n      to provide over 400 W h of energy to support rover peak power\n      operations and provide auxiliary heating and operations overnight.\n \n      Temperature-sensitive electronics were housed in the rover warm\n      electronics box (WEB) which is a box built with honeycomb\n      composite material and insulated with 2.5 cm of opacified aerogel.\n      A combination of radioisotope heater units, waste heat from\n      electronics, and auxiliary heating by survival heaters ensured\n      that the internal electronics were maintained between -40 and +50\n      degrees C as the external Mars environment cycle ranged from 0 to\n      -97 degrees C.  Survival heating in the WEB requires not more than\n      100 W h of energy during the coldest environment conditions.  The\n      rechargeable batteries housed in the WEB supplied this energy.\n \n      The rover received commands and transmitted data to the Earth\n      through two distinct systems: a direct-to-Earth X-band system\n      supported by both a low-gain antenna and a steerable high-gain\n      antenna (HGA), and a UHF system supported by a monopole antenna\n      which enables relay communication to orbiters at Mars.  Early in\n      the surface mission, the X-band system through the high-gain\n      antenna supported up to 28.8 kbps to a 70 m Deep Space Network\n      (DSN) station.  Commands were received through the high-gain\n      antenna at a rate of up to 2000 bps.  The X-band system through\n      the low-gain antenna provided a minimum capability of transmitting\n      telemetry at 40 bps and receiving commands at 40 bps throughout\n      the MER missions.  The UHF system supported telemetry rates of up\n      to 256 kbps during orbiter passes which lasted up to 8 minutes\n      each.  The UHF system also supported a command receipt capability\n      of 8 kbps through Odyssey only.\n \n      The computing, command, and data handling functions of the rover\n      were supported by a 20 MHz 32-bit RAD6000 processor housed in a\n      Versa Module Europa (VME) card cage.  This radiation hardened\n      processor had access to 128 Mbytes of DRAM and 256 Mbytes of\n      nonvolatile flash memory that supported a multiprocess C-coded\n      software architecture.  This system, supported by auxiliary\n      processing functions housed on boards within the VME card cage,\n      had the capability to acquire images from pairs of cameras, drive\n      up to 10 motors simultaneously from 35 motors located on the\n      vehicle, and process data from three spectrometers.  The\n      multiprocess architecture allowed communication, image\n      acquisition, and operation of payload elements to proceed\n      simultaneously.\n \n      During the surface mission, the rovers communicated on X-band\n      typically once a day, reporting on status and the results of the\n      execution of commands transmitted that day.  Data were also\n      relayed through the UHF communication system to the Mars Global\n      Surveyor and Mars Odyssey orbiters.  Useful over-flights by these\n      orbiters at the landing site occurred as frequently as twice\n      per day per orbiter.\n \n      Each rover carried the Athena Science Payload consisting of two\n      remote sensing instruments that viewed the terrain from the top of\n      a mast 154 cm above the ground, four devices for in-situ analysis\n      on the end of a robotic arm and several magnets and calibration\n      targets.  [SQUYRESETAL2003] describes this payload, the mast, the\n      robotic arm, and the plans for science investigation in more\n      detail.  Azimuth and elevation actuators permitted the collection\n      of data sets for specific targets, regions, or full 360-degree\n      panoramas from the mast instruments, which are the stereo\n      multispectral Panoramic Camera (Pancam) and Miniature Thermal\n      Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES).  The five degree-of-freedom\n      robotic arm positioned the following devices on rocks and soils\n      for in-situ analysis or rock abrasion: Alpha Particle X-ray\n      Spectrometer (APXS), Moessbauer Spectrometer (MB), Microscopic\n      Imager (MI), and Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT).\n \n      In addition, the stereo navigation cameras (Navcams) mounted on\n      the top of the mast and the stereo hazard detection cameras\n      (Hazcams) pointed towards the ground beneath the solar panels in\n      the front and rear of the rover were required for engineering\n      purposes (rover navigation, hazard avoidance, and safe movement\n      purposes and positioning of the robotic arm), but were also used\n      for science analysis [MAKIETAL2003].  [ARVIDSONETAL2003] provides\n      more detail on the use of rover engineering sensors for assessing\n      terrain and soil physical properties, dust accumulation, and\n      other related investigations.\n \n      The MER rover coordinate frame is defined as follows:\n \n      -- +Zr axis is normal to the rover top deck plane and points down,\n         from the top deck toward the wheels;\n \n      -- +Xr axis is parallel to the rover top deck plane and points\n         from the center of the top deck toward the PMA assembly;\n \n      -- +Yr completes the right hand frame.\n \n      The origin of the MER rover 'navigation' frame is directly above\n      the middle wheels, as shown in the diagram below.  A separate\n      MER rover 'mechanical' frame has its origin 29 cm toward the\n      front wheels (in the +Xr direction) but is otherwise identical.\n \n                                 UHF    /\\\n                         HGA            \\/ PMA\n                          .--.    #     ||\n                         /    \\   #     ||\n                        |      |  #     ||\n                         \\    /=. #     ||\n                          `--' || #     ||                 Rover\n                       =======================           (deployed)\n                             |    =o=.    |\n                             |  .'

Each wheel and\n      steering degree of freedom was independently actuated, which\n      allowed the vehicle to turn in place (turning diameter 1.9 m), to\n      skid steer to a tighter angle (turning diameter as small\n      as 0.9 m), to turn in gradual arcs, or to drag wheels that\n      effectively trench the Martian regolith.  When moving on flat\n      terrain, the vehicle could achieve a top speed of 5 cm/s.  Under\n      autonomous control using its hazard avoidance system, the rover\n      drove with an average speed of about 1 cm/sec.\n \n      The rover was powered by a combination of solar arrays and\n      rechargeable batteries.  The solar panel provides 30 strings of\n      triple junction cells (gallium indium phosphorus, gallium\n      arsenide, and germanium) covering 1.3 square meters, which\n      produced about 800 to 900 W hours per sol at the beginning of the\n      MER mission.  Each rover had two reference solar cells, one that\n      measures short circuit current and another that measures open\n      circuit voltage.  Due to the change in season from late southern\n      summer to early southern autumn, and the degradation in\n      performance due to dust deposition, the energy produced by this\n      array dropped to about 600 W h per sol, 90 sols after landing.\n      Energy was stored in two 8 A h lithium ion rechargeable batteries\n      to provide over 400 W h of energy to support rover peak power\n      operations and provide auxiliary heating and operations overnight.\n \n      Temperature-sensitive electronics were housed in the rover warm\n      electronics box (WEB) which is a box built with honeycomb\n      composite material and insulated with 2.5 cm of opacified aerogel.\n      A combination of radioisotope heater units, waste heat from\n      electronics, and auxiliary heating by survival heaters ensured\n      that the internal electronics were maintained between -40 and +50\n      degrees C as the external Mars environment cycle ranged from 0 to\n      -97 degrees C.  Survival heating in the WEB requires not more than\n      100 W h of energy during the coldest environment conditions.  The\n      rechargeable batteries housed in the WEB supplied this energy.\n \n      The rover received commands and transmitted data to the Earth\n      through two distinct systems: a direct-to-Earth X-band system\n      supported by both a low-gain antenna and a steerable high-gain\n      antenna (HGA), and a UHF system supported by a monopole antenna\n      which enables relay communication to orbiters at Mars.  Early in\n      the surface mission, the X-band system through the high-gain\n      antenna supported up to 28.8 kbps to a 70 m Deep Space Network\n      (DSN) station.  Commands were received through the high-gain\n      antenna at a rate of up to 2000 bps.  The X-band system through\n      the low-gain antenna provided a minimum capability of transmitting\n      telemetry at 40 bps and receiving commands at 40 bps throughout\n      the MER missions.  The UHF system supported telemetry rates of up\n      to 256 kbps during orbiter passes which lasted up to 8 minutes\n      each.  The UHF system also supported a command receipt capability\n      of 8 kbps through Odyssey only.\n \n      The computing, command, and data handling functions of the rover\n      were supported by a 20 MHz 32-bit RAD6000 processor housed in a\n      Versa Module Europa (VME) card cage.  This radiation hardened\n      processor had access to 128 Mbytes of DRAM and 256 Mbytes of\n      nonvolatile flash memory that supported a multiprocess C-coded\n      software architecture.  This system, supported by auxiliary\n      processing functions housed on boards within the VME card cage,\n      had the capability to acquire images from pairs of cameras, drive\n      up to 10 motors simultaneously from 35 motors located on the\n      vehicle, and process data from three spectrometers.  The\n      multiprocess architecture allowed communication, image\n      acquisition, and operation of payload elements to proceed\n      simultaneously.\n \n      During the surface mission, the rovers communicated on X-band\n      typically once a day, reporting on status and the results of the\n      execution of commands transmitted that day.  Data were also\n      relayed through the UHF communication system to the Mars Global\n      Surveyor and Mars Odyssey orbiters.  Useful over-flights by these\n      orbiters at the landing site occurred as frequently as twice\n      per day per orbiter.\n \n      Each rover carried the Athena Science Payload consisting of two\n      remote sensing instruments that viewed the terrain from the top of\n      a mast 154 cm above the ground, four devices for in-situ analysis\n      on the end of a robotic arm and several magnets and calibration\n      targets.  [SQUYRESETAL2003] describes this payload, the mast, the\n      robotic arm, and the plans for science investigation in more\n      detail.  Azimuth and elevation actuators permitted the collection\n      of data sets for specific targets, regions, or full 360-degree\n      panoramas from the mast instruments, which are the stereo\n      multispectral Panoramic Camera (Pancam) and Miniature Thermal\n      Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES).  The five degree-of-freedom\n      robotic arm positioned the following devices on rocks and soils\n      for in-situ analysis or rock abrasion: Alpha Particle X-ray\n      Spectrometer (APXS), Moessbauer Spectrometer (MB), Microscopic\n      Imager (MI), and Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT).\n \n      In addition, the stereo navigation cameras (Navcams) mounted on\n      the top of the mast and the stereo hazard detection cameras\n      (Hazcams) pointed towards the ground beneath the solar panels in\n      the front and rear of the rover were required for engineering\n      purposes (rover navigation, hazard avoidance, and safe movement\n      purposes and positioning of the robotic arm), but were also used\n      for science analysis [MAKIETAL2003].  [ARVIDSONETAL2003] provides\n      more detail on the use of rover engineering sensors for assessing\n      terrain and soil physical properties, dust accumulation, and\n      other related investigations.\n \n      The MER rover coordinate frame is defined as follows:\n \n      -- +Zr axis is normal to the rover top deck plane and points down,\n         from the top deck toward the wheels;\n \n      -- +Xr axis is parallel to the rover top deck plane and points\n         from the center of the top deck toward the PMA assembly;\n \n      -- +Yr completes the right hand frame.\n \n      The origin of the MER rover 'navigation' frame is directly above\n      the middle wheels, as shown in the diagram below.  A separate\n      MER rover 'mechanical' frame has its origin 29 cm toward the\n      front wheels (in the +Xr direction) but is otherwise identical.\n \n                                 UHF    /\\\n                         HGA            \\/ PMA\n                          .--.    #     ||\n                         /    \\   #     ||\n                        |      |  #     ||\n                         \\    /=. #     ||\n                          `--' || #     ||                 Rover\n                       =======================           (deployed)\n                             |    =o=.    |\n                             |  .'

To carry out this function it is equipped with\n    high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,\n    and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n    The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n    equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at\n    Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,\n    Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of\n    the complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the\n    third is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n    Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their\n    diameters, construction, or operational characteristics:\n    70-m diameter, standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m\n    diameter (HEF), and 34-m beam waveguide (BWG).\n \n    For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - 2001 Mars Odyssey\n  ============================================\n    The 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY) spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin\n    Astronautics (LMA).

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    Lunar Prospector (LP) is a small, simple, spin-stabilized spacecraft\n    with minimal operational requirements [BINDERETAL1998].  Its fueled\n    mass is 305 kg.  The spacecraft bus is a graphite-epoxy drum that is\n    1.37 m in diameter and 1.28 m tall.  Power is provided by solar\n    cells mounted on the surface of the bus assembly, which produce an\n    average of 186 w.  There is also a rechargeable, 4.8 amp-hr NiCd\n    battery for power during night side passes.  The science instruments\n    are mounted on three 2.5 m booms.  The Gamma Ray Spectrometer is\n    mounted on one boom, the Neutron Spectrometer and Alpha Particle\n    Spectrometers are mounted on another boom, and the Magnetometer and\n    Electron Reflectometer are mounted on the third boom.  The\n    Magnetometer instrument is mounted on a 1.2 m long boom extending\n    beyond the main boom to isolate it from the Electron Reflectometer.\n \n    The spacecraft bus houses three fuel tanks, six engines, and five\n    electronic units.  The fuel tanks at launch hold 138 kg of hydrazine\n    pressurized with helium.  There are two aft axial engines, two\n    forward axial engines, and two tangential engines.\n \n    The communication system consists of an S-band transponder, an omni\n    antenna with 3-pi steradian antenna pattern for uplink and downlink,\n    and a medium gain antenna for downlink.  The engineering-only\n    downlink data rate is 300 bps and the science/engineering downlink\n    data rate is 3600 bps.\n \n    Command and control of the spacecraft is achieved by a simple\n    Command and Data Handling (C&DH) unit.  As an individual command is\n    uplinked to the spacecraft, the C&DH directs the command to the\n    appropriate subsystem.  All science and engineering data are\n    collected by the C&DH and then are buffered and formatted for\n    downlink by the C&DH.  The data are downlinked at 1800 bps\n    immediately and simultaneously dumped into a solid state recorder.\n    The data stored on the solid state recorder is downlinked 53 minutes\n    later.  These delayed data frames are interleaved into the real-time\n    data stream, yielding a total downlink rate of 3600 bps.  The\n    purpose of the delayed stream is to receive data acquired during\n    communications blackout periods and to eliminate the need for a\n    commandable data recorder.\n \n    The LP spacecraft clock or frame counter increments once every 2\n    seconds.  It is stored in a 24-bit register.  This means that the\n    clock will reset after about 33.5 million seconds or about once per\n    year.  The clock reset on January 30, 1999 at about 12:09 UTC, which\n    was early in the Extended Mission.\n \n \n  Spacecraft Coordinate System\n  ============================\n    The Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) stage and spacecraft body\n    coordinate system is discussed below.  The origin of\n    coordinates is: a) in the separation plane between the\n    spacecraft and the adapter of the TLI stage; and b) at the\n    geometric center of the equilateral triangle defined by the\n    bolt holes for the separation nuts.\n \n    The Z axis is normal to the separation plane.  The +Z direction\n    is towards the medium gain antenna (forward) end of the\n    spacecraft.  The X axis is in the separation plane between the\n    spacecraft and the adapter of the TLI stage.  The -X direction\n    is parallel to the centerline of instrument boom No.  1 and\n    towards the Gamma Ray Spectrometer.  The Y axis is defined by\n    the right-hand rule.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    The Deep Space Network (DSN) is a telecommunications facility\n    managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute\n    of Technology for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space\n    Administration (NASA).\n \n    The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way communications\n    between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar system.  To\n    carry out this function it is equipped with high-power transmitters,\n    low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and\n    control systems.\n \n    The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n    equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone\n    (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and\n    Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the complexes are\n    located in the northern hemisphere while the third is in the\n    southern hemisphere.\n \n    Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their diameters,\n    construction, or operational characteristics: 70-m diameter,\n    standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter (HEF), and\n    34-m beam waveguide (BWG).  These DSN complexes, in conjunction with\n    telecommunications subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft,\n    constitute the major elements of instrumentation for radio science\n    investigations.\n \n    For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].\n \n \n  Science Packages\n  ================\n    The Lunar Prospector spacecraft has five science instruments.  The\n    instruments are a Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), a Neutron\n    Spectrometer (NS), an Alpha Particle Spectrometer (APS), a\n    Magnetometer (MAG), and an Electron Reflectometer (ER).  A Doppler\n    Gravity Experiment (DGE) uses Doppler tracking data for deriving\n    gravity measurements.  In addition, the spacecraft spin rate and\n    attitude are determined on the ground from data derived from a sun\n    sensor and an IR Earth/Moon limb crossing sensor.",

	"display_description": "Instrument Host Overview\n    =========================\n \n    The LCROSS (Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite)\n    mission was conceived as a low-cost means of determining the\n    nature of hydrogen detected at the polar regions of the moon.\n \n    LCROSS was selected as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)\n    secondary payload on April 10th, 2006 and launched with LRO on\n    June 18th, 2009.  To meet the requirements of a secondary\n    payload, the LCROSS Shepherding Spacecraft (SSC) was built\n    around an EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) ring, originally\n    designed as a mating interface for up to six small spacecraft or\n    experiments as secondary payloads on Delta IV and Atlas V\n    launches.  Developed by Northrop Grumman, the SSC featured five\n    equipment panels and a solar array mounted radially at the ESPA\n    mate ports.  A single monopropellant tank was mounted within the\n    ESPA ring.  For launch, the nearly 900 kg (wet mass) LCROSS\n    SSC was mated between the Centaur upper stage and LRO.\n \n    The SSC utilized copies of several LRO avionics units, including\n    its RAD750-based single-board computer, power and thruster\n    control electronics, S-band communications electronics, and\n    SpaceWire bus electronics.  LCROSS flight software derived\n    heavily from software on previous programs, including EO-1 and\n    WMAP.  LCROSS communicated in S-band via two omnidirectional\n    antennas and two medium-gain antennas.  Transponder electronics\n    enabled downlink at data rates up to 1 Mbps and uplink at 16\n    kbps.  Following launch and LRO separation, attitude control was\n    passed from the Centaur to the SSC.  The attitude control system\n    (ACS) provided three-axis control using an inertial reference\n    unit (IRU; no accelerometers), a star tracker, coarse sun\n    sensors for emergency automated sun-relative attitude capture\n    and tracking, and a set of eight monopropellant 5 N thrusters.\n    Two additional 22 N thrusters provided orbit maneuvering\n    capability.  The ACS featured twelve control mode/submode\n    combinations, six tailored for specific operations while\n    attached to the Centaur, and a second set for use after Centaur\n    separation.  The LCROSS propellant tank contained just over 305\n    kg of hydrazine for both attitude control and orbit maneuvering.\n    The LCROSS power system featured a 368 W solar array and four 20\n    A-h batteries.  LCROSS performed thermal control using a\n    combination of resistive heaters, passive radiators, and\n    multi-layer insulation.\n \n    The LCROSS Payload\n \n    The LCROSS Payload consists of nine science instruments, their\n    supporting electrical, mechanical and optical harnesses, a\n    central data handling unit (DHU) assembly, and thermal hardware\n    (heaters, thermistors, and thermostats), all assembled onto the\n    LCROSS spacecraft R6 Radiator Panel.  Eight of the nine science\n    instruments are configured with their apertures in the +X\n    direction (spacecraft body frame/SBF) and are accommodated in\n    the Payload Observation Deck (POD).  The ninth instrument, near\n    infrared spectrometer #2 (NSP2), has its entrance optical\n    element orientated in the -Z direction (spacecraft body\n    frame/SBF).  The Payload is located on the inboard side of the\n    LCROSS spacecraft R6 Panel.\n \n    Visible Camera\n \n    The LCROSS visible camera (VIS) is a ruggedized analog video\n    camera from the RocketCamTM camera family developed by Ecliptic\n    Enterprises, Inc.  The unit consists of a camera module and a\n    lens.  The camera's focal plane CCD sensor is 752 [H] x 582 [V]\n    pixel format, operating at 30 Hz (60 fields/sec).  The flight\n    unit's lens is a 12 mm (focal length), f/1.2 lens providing a\n    30.1 degree [H] x 22.8 degree [V] (37.8 degree [Diagonal]) field-of-view.\n    Interlaced NTSC fields are sampled by the Data Handling Unit\n    (DHU) at 720 x 243 resolution resulting in a final image\n    resolution of 720 x 486 pixels.  Each pixel is 24-bit RGB with 8\n    bits per color channel.  These images are compressed using a\n    lossy compression algorithm performed by the Analog Devices 611\n    Video Codec set on 80% quality and decompressed on the ground.\n    The LCROSS visible camera contains no cryogenic liquids or\n    moving parts.  The visible camera's peak power during operation\n    is 2.9 W.  The visible camera has been fixed to an\n    auto-gain/white balance setting.\n \n    Near-Infrared Cameras\n \n    The LCROSS payload contains two near infrared (IR) (0.9-1.7 um)\n    cameras (NIR1/NIR2).  Each camera consists of a Goodrich Sensors\n    Unlimited model SU320-KTX and a CCTV lens. Each camera's focal\n    plane InGaAs sensor has a 320 [H] x 240 [V] pixel format.  The\n    25 mm, f/1.4 C-mount glass lens provides a 28.7 degree [H] x 21.7\n    degree [V] (36.0 degree [Diagonal]) field-of-view.  Although the\n    camera's native format provides 320 [H] x 240 [V] 12-bit images,\n    the images are converted within the camera to an analog NTSC\n    signal before transfer to the DHU where they are captured at 720\n    [H] x 486 [V].  Due to similar processing within the DHU as\n    needed for the VIS images, the two NIR camera images are\n    captured as 24-bit per pixel RGB.  Because the NIR cameras\n    provide grayscale images, the three RGB channels are identical\n    except for noise introduced in the conversion to and from\n    NTSC. These images are compressed in the DHU using a lossy\n    compression algorithm performed by the Analog Devices 611 Video\n    Codec set on 80% quality and decompressed on the ground.  In\n    addition to a camera body and a lens, near infrared camera #1\n    (NIR1) also contains a long-pass filter (wavelength > 1.4 um).\n    NIR2, in comparison, is filter-less.\n \n    Lenses for both cameras were provided by UkaOptics\n    (http://www.ukaoptics.com/ #2514M) as part of the standard\n    Goodrich package. These lenses are not optimized for the IR.\n    The IR throughput of the lenses has not been documented, but is\n    expected to be ~40%.  The near-infrared cameras contain no\n    cryogenic liquids or moving parts.  There is an internal\n    thermo-electric cooler that actively cools the InGaAs sensor.\n    The manufacturer default settings for this cooler are used.\n    Each camera's peak power during operation is 1.6 W.  Both gain\n    and exposure times are configurable by commands sent to the\n    camera.\n \n    Mid-Infrared Cameras\n \n    The LCROSS payload contains two mid-infrared (MIR) (6.0-13.5 um)\n    cameras (MIR1/MIR2).  Mid-infrared camera #1 (MIR1) is a\n    ruggedized vanadium oxide (VOx) microbolometer MIRIC TB2-30,\n    from Thermoteknix Ltd.  Mid-infrared camera #2 (MIR2) is model\n    ThermoVision Micron from Flir Systems/Indigo Operations.  Each\n    camera's uncooled microbolometer focal plane sensor has a 164\n    [H] x 128 [V] pixel format and is digitized at 14-bit\n    resolution.  Each camera has a 30 mm, f/1.6 lens providing a\n    15.0 degree [H] x 11.0 degree [V] (18.6 degree [Diagonal]) field-of-view.\n    MIR1 also contains a 6-10 Om bandpass filter.  MIR2 is\n    filter-less.  MIR1 is backfilled with dry Argon gas to prevent\n    degradation due to humidity for terrestrial applications and\n    does not contain any component volatile in vacuum.  Internal to\n    both MIR modules is an instrumented-motorized shutter to provide\n    a reference for temperature measurements.  Each camera's peak\n    power during operation is 1.3 W.  A camera gain, which\n    determines the sensitivity to temperature scenes (high gain: -20\n    degC < T < +150 degC, low gain: +150 degC < T < +500 degC), is\n    configurable with a command sent to the camera.\n \n    Total Luminance Photometer\n \n    The Total Luminance Photometer (TLP) provides visible light\n    (400-1000 nm) intensity data at a 1000 Hz sampling rate.  The\n    TLP instrument consists of two elements: (1) the Sensor\n    Electronics Module (SEM), which contains the optics and sensor\n    assembly and signal filtering, and (2) the Digital Electronics\n    Module (DEM), which converts the analog sensor signal to a\n    digital output, as well as higher order functionality.  The DEM\n    is a commercial package that was modified for LCROSS.  This\n    instrument is designed and manufactured by NASA Ames Research\n    Center.  The optics in the SEM delivers an unobstructed ~10\n    degree diameter field-of-view.  The TLP's sensor element is an\n    uncooled Advanced Photonix, Inc.  (API) avalanche photo diode\n    (APD) packaged in a dryair sensor container that can operate in\n    a vacuum.  The TLP SEM is connected by an electrical harness to\n    the TLP DEM.  The SEM and DEM are located within the Payload\n    Observation Deck (POD) and on the R6 Panel, respectively.  The\n    DEM is interfaced with the DHU (also on the R6 Panel) via a\n    second cable, from which it is controlled.  The SEM and DEM's\n    peak power during operation are 2.5 W and 12.0 W, respectively.\n \n    Visible Spectrometer\n \n    The LCROSS visible spectrometer (VSP) is a modified-commercial\n    model from Ocean Optics Ltd., with its core operation based on\n    their COTS QE65000 model.  It has been adapted for space use and\n    is of similar design to a recently delivered spectrometer to Los\n    Alamos for a Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) payload for launch in\n    2011.  The VSP spectrometer design consists of an FC optical\n    fiber input (0.11 NA) feeding a 25 micron x 1 mm entrance slit,\n    where light is diffracted by a 1-inch f/4 optical cross\n    Czerny-Turner spectrometer (grating 600 lines/mm, blazed at 350\n    nm) with an oversized camera mirror.  The ~263-650 nm spectrum\n    from the slit is imaged onto a 1044 x 64 pixel Hamamatsu CCD\n    detector.  The data is co-added within the spectrometer,\n    delivering a 16- bit, 1 x 1044 pixel spectra to the DHU\n    electronics for packaging.  The first 1024 pixels contain\n    spectral data.  The remaining 20 pixels contain provide\n    temporally coincident but off-slit dark reference pixels.  The\n    VSP resolving power is R~300, 500, and 850 at 300, 400 and 600\n    nm, respectively.  The VSP contains no moving parts.  The CCD\n    detector is cooled by an internal Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC),\n    whose set point is programmable.  The VSP power is 4.8 W (TEC\n    off), and can reach 11.8 W (at TEC setting -10 degC at operating\n    temperature +19-20 degC).  Integration time (between 8 ms and 65.5\n    s) is configurable.  Additionally, the VSP supports two\n    operation modes - single and bracket spectra.  The former is a\n    single spectra acquisition of the appropriate requested\n    integration time.  The latter is a three-spectra acquisition\n    defined by a base integration time and a multiplier that is\n    divided or multiplied by the base integration time to yield a\n    shorter or longer exposure time, respectively.  The VSP is fed\n    by a 75 cm length 600-micron core-diameter UV/Vis glass fiber\n    attached to a fore-optics unit in the POD.  This fore-optics\n    unit (see below) is a fixed two-mirror and one lens system\n    designed to provide a one degree diameter field-of-view.\n \n    Near-Infrared Spectrometers\n \n    The LCROSS payload contains two near-infrared spectrometers\n    (NSP1/NSP2), located on the R6 Panel.  Their electronics units\n    are identical, but they have different fore-optics designs.\n    Near infrared spectrometer #1, NSP1, also known as the nadir\n    NSP, is located inside the POD and its aperture is positioned in\n    the +X direction (spacecraft body frame/SBF).  Near infrared\n    spectrometer #2, NSP2, also known as the solar-viewer or\n    occultation NSP, has its wide-field aperture centered along the\n    -Z direction (spacecraft body frame/SBF).  Both spectrometers\n    provide 1.20-2.45 um spectral coverage and nominal resolution\n    0.035 um/pixel, yielding resolving powers R ~ 37-65 (NSP1) and R\n    ~ 36-77 (NSP2).  Both spectrometers are manufactured by\n    Polychromix, a company whose primary spectrometer line is\n    designed for material analysis and chemical sensing.  The\n    spectrometers are designed to take a single SMA NA=0.22 fiber as\n    input instead of a slit, whose diameter defines the instrument\n    resolution.  Since each spectrometer contains a single\n    TEC-cooled InGaAs sensor element, a 1D-spectrum is created using\n    an innovative electronically-tunable MEMS device that spatially\n    masks the dispersed spectrum within the instrument.  This series\n    of masks undergoes a digital transform on the ground to recreate\n    the spectral information.  The spectrometer contains no moving\n    parts (excluding the MEMS chip) and the peak power for each NSP\n    is 2.5 W.  NSP1 and NSP2 are each fed by a single 600-micron\n    core-diameter low-OH glass fiber of length 75 cm and 1.45 m,\n    respectively, attached to a fore-optic.  The NSP1 fore-optics\n    unit (see below) is located within the POD and is a fixed\n    two-mirror and one lens system designed to provide 1 degree\n    diameter field-of-view.  The NSP2 fore-optic (see below) is a\n    diffuser providing ~130 degree fieldof- view, and is located external\n    to the POD housing.  Both spectrometers have three modes, Impact\n    Flash (IF), Hadamard Spectrum (HS) and Diagnostic Mode (DM),\n    which are configurable by sending a command to the units.\n \n    Fore-Optics and Fibers\n \n    The LCROSS payload contains two fore-optic units and three\n    fibers.  The three single-core fibers connect the electrical\n    units of the three LCROSS spectrometers to their respective\n    fore-optics (i.e., light-gathering optics).  All fibers are\n    manufactured by Fiberguide Industries.  The two fore-optics, a\n    dual-scope fore-optic feeding the NSP1 and VSP spectrometers and\n    a diffuser fore-optic feeding the NSP2 spectrometer, have been\n    designed specifically for the LCROSS mission by Aurora\n    Technologies.  The dualscope fore-optic provides 1 degree\n    diameter field-of-view (per scope) and a separation between the\n    two scopes of < 0.1 degrees.  The diffuser fore-optic provides\n    an unattenuated ~130 degree field-of-view.  The fibers were chosen to\n    optimize for the band-pass and be compatible with the throughput\n    and entrance optic requirements by the spectrometers.  For the\n    VSP, the fiber is a 75 cm SuperguideG UV/VIS Spectral Range with\n    NA=0.12+/-0.02.  For the NSPs, the fibers are AnhydroguideG Low\n    OH fibers with NA=0.22+/-0.02, with lengths 75 cm and 145 cm for\n    NSP1 and NSP2, respectively.  All three fibers have 600 Om\n    core-diameters and are encased in a 1/8 inch (ID) stainless\n    steel monocoil for ruggedization.\n \n    Data Handling Unit\n \n    The LCROSS Data Handling Unit (DHU) is a ruggedized video camera\n    controller and data handling system based on the ruggedized\n    Digital Video Systems (DVS) developed by Ecliptic Enterprises,\n    Inc.  It captures and transmits compressed digital spectrometer,\n    video and photometric data telemetry (in CCSDS format) from all\n    nine instruments from the LCROSS science payload.  The DHU is a\n    single conduction-cooled chassis designed to operate as\n    independently as possible from its host vehicle.  In the\n    limiting case, DHU operation is completely self-contained except\n    for activation/deactivation commands that originate from the\n    ground.  The DHU can store up to 10 slots of Non- Volatile\n    Memory (NVM), which can be used for sequencing power and\n    operational commands to the science instruments.  The DHU\n    contains no moving parts, operates from the 32 V power supply by\n    the spacecraft power bus, and its peak power during operation is\n    13.5 W.  The DHU also provides the time-stamping function of all\n    the science instruments and itself and provides error logs for\n    when science data frames are dropped or corrupted due to\n    bandwidth or performance issues.",

For GRAIL this is partly true.\n  There are two data types, the primary is from the links between the\n  spacecraft, and those data become available via telemetry.

This science link supplements the LGRS on-board\n  observations and, again, make the DSN a part of the GRAIL science\n  instrumentation.  The following sections provide an overview of the\n  spacecraft and their science instruments followed by the DSN ground\n  system.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n  =====================================\n \n    Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory Spacecraft\n    ---------------------------------------------------\n    The GRAIL spacecraft design was based on the Lockheed Martin (LM)\n    Experimental Small Satellite-11 technology demonstration mission\n    for the United States Air Force, and the avionics were derived\n    from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. A single-string\n    architecture met this short mission's reliability requirements.\n    The resulting design met all GRAIL mission and science\n    requirements with ample technical margins, providing flexibility\n    to solve problems that might arise during development and which\n    met or exceeded design principles established by the Jet\n    Propulsion Laboratory.\n \n    Each of the two GRAIL spacecraft, GRAIL-A and GRAIL-B, was about\n    the size of a washing machine and had about 200 kg of mass. They\n    were nearly identical; but the need to point antennas at one\n    another required differences in the MoonKAM mounting and in the\n    angles of the star trackers used for attitude control and the\n    antennas through which the orbiters measured the changing\n    distance between them. These factors also required that GRAIL-B\n    precede GRAIL-A in lunar orbit.\n \n    Each spacecraft bus was a rectangular composite structure. The\n    science payload ranging antennas were in thermal enclosures and\n    were mounted so that they were nominally on the line between the\n    centers of mass of the two spacecraft. The other components of the\n    payload instrument were on a single interior bus panel for easy\n    integration and testing.\n \n    Two non-articulated solar arrays of XSS-11 heritage were deployed\n    just after separation from the launch vehicle. Warm gas systems,\n    identical to those on XSS-11, provided delta-V for maneuvers and\n    unloading of the 3 reaction wheels. Additional attitude sensing\n    components included an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a sun\n    sensor and a star tracker.\n \n    Command and Data Handling (C&DH), power management, and the\n    lithium ion battery also had XSS-11 heritage. The S-band\n    telecommunications sub-system for communication with the DSN used\n    components with heritage from Themis and Genesis.\n \n    The spacecraft was built and the science payload was integrated\n    and tested at Lockheed Martin's Denver facility. LM used two\n    system-level spacecraft test labs (STL) and one software simulator\n    (SoftSim) testbed with unlimited copies that enabled integration\n    and verification of all hardware and software throughout the\n    Assembly Test and Launch Operations (ATLO) cycle.\n \n    See [HOFFMAN2009] for more information about the spacecraft.\n \n    Spacecraft Configurations\n    -------------------------\n    During its mission, GRAIL needed to operate in four distinct\n    mission configurations.\n \n    Launch: During launch, the two spacecraft had to be fitted together\n    within the nose cone, or payload fairing, of the launch vehicle.\n    Large parts, such as the solar arrays, were designed to be folded\n    up.\n \n    Cruise: As soon as the two spacecraft were clear of the launch\n    vehicle, the body-fixed solar arrays were deployed to begin\n    producing power. The high-gain antenna also became operational.\n \n    Lunar Orbit Insertion: The lunar orbit insertion required numerous\n    maneuvers to circularize the two orbits. No science observations\n    took place, as the spacecraft were not in formation flying yet.\n \n    Science Operations: During the Science Phase, the two spacecraft\n    were placed in a precision formation flying configuration in order\n    to point to each other and exchange two radio links at Ka- and\n    S-bands.\n \n    Coordinate Systems\n    ------------------\n \n    Two coordinate systems are used to reference the various GRAIL\n    instruments. The definitions are summarized below.\n \n    1) Mechanical Frame (MF): This is defined by the spacecraft\n    manufacturer. It is the reference frame for such things as KBR\n    horn location, center of mass, and thruster locations.\n \n    +X = Parallel to, and in opposite direction from, the solar array\n    normal vector\n    +Z = Normal to star tracker bus plate\n    +Y = +Z ? +X\n \n    An onboard attitude control sub-system approximately orients the\n    mechanical frame with -Z along the line of flight and -/+ Y\n    pointed towards the moon.\n \n    2) Science Reference Frame (SRF): This is the Mechanical Frame as\n    realized by the Star Tracker. If the Star Tracker were perfectly\n    aligned, MF would equal SRF. SRF is the reference frame for GRAIL\n    science measurements.\n \n    Major Spacecraft Components\n    ---------------------------\n    Science Payload Instruments:\n \n    There are two payload elements on each GRAIL orbiter: the Lunar\n    Gravity Ranging System (LGRS) which is the science instrument, and\n    the MoonKAM lunar-imager which is used for Education and Public\n    Outreach. The LGRS is based on the instrument used for the Gravity\n    Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, which has been\n    mapping Earth's gravity since 2002. The LGRS is responsible for\n    sending and receiving the signals needed to accurately and\n    precisely measure the changes in range between the two orbiters.\n    The LGRS consists of an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO), Microwave\n    Assembly (MWA), a Time-Transfer Assembly (TTA), and the Gravity\n    Recovery Processor Assembly (GPA).\n \n    The USO provides a steady reference signal that is used by all of\n    the instrument subsystems. Within the LGRS, the USO provides the\n    reference frequency for the MWA and the TTA. The MWA converts the\n    USO reference signal to the Ka-band frequency, which is\n    transmitted to the other orbiter.\n \n    The function of the TTA is to provide a two-way time-transfer link\n    between the spacecraft to both synchronize and measure the clock\n    offset between the two LGRS clocks. The TTA generates an S-band\n    signal from the USO reference frequency and sends a GPS-like\n    ranging code to the other spacecraft. The GPA combines all the\n    inputs received from the MWA and TTA to produce the radiometric\n    data that are downlinked to the ground. In addition to acquiring\n    the inter-spacecraft measurements, the LGRS also provides a\n    one-way signal to the ground based on the USO, which is\n    transmitted via the X-band Radio Science Beacon (RSB). The\n    steady-state drift of the USO is measured via the one-way Doppler\n    data provided by the RSB.\n \n    The LGRS instrument is summarized below.\n \n         2 X-band beacon antennas for Doppler ranging measurements\n           when the spacecraft was visible from Earth. The X-band\n           signal was carrier-only and not\n         1 S-band time-transfer system antenna, which sent a\n           time-synchronization code back and forth between the\n           spacecraft\n         1 Ka-band ranging antenna for precision distance measurement\n           between the spacecraft\n \n    For more information on the GRAIL radio systems, see\n    [KLIPSTEINETAL2009].\n \n    Structures:\n \n    The solar panels and antennas were body fixed, so there were no\n    moving parts in the spacecraft structure that would affect science\n    observations.\n \n    Telecommunications Sub-System:\n \n    The telecom sub-system included the following on each spacecraft:\n \n         2 S-band transponder antennas to communicate with Earth\n \n    Each of the pairs of S-band transponder antennas had one antenna\n    mounted on the sunny side of the spacecraft and one mounted on the\n    dark side. The sunny-side antennas pointed to Earth during the\n    full moon and the dark-side antennas pointed to Earth during new\n    moon. This design obviated the need to mechanically rotate the\n    antennas during the mission, which would have moved the\n    spacecraft's center of mass with respect to the Ka-Band ranging\n    and X-Band beacon paths, disturbing the science measurements.\n \n    Propulsion Sub-System:\n \n    The propulsion sub-system on each spacecraft included:\n \n    A propellant tank, which could hold up to 103.5 kilograms of the\n    monopropellant hydrazine.\n \n    A hydrazine catalytic thruster for lunar-orbit insertion and\n    trajectory changes, and a warm-gas system with 8 thruster valves\n    for attitude control and other small maneuvers.\n \n    Command and Data-Handling Sub-System:\n \n    The C&DH sub-system controlled all spacecraft functions. This\n    system:\n \n         * managed all forms of data on the spacecraft;\n         * executed commands (including maneuver commands) sent from\n           Earth;\n         * prepared data for transmission to Earth;\n         * managed collection of solar power and charging of the\n           batteries;\n         * collected and processed information about all sub-systems\n           and payloads;\n         * kept and distributed the spacecraft time;\n         * calculated spacecraft position in orbit around the Moon;\n         * autonomously monitored and responded to any onboard\n           problems that occurred.\n \n    The key parts of this system were:\n \n         Space Flight Computer\n         Flight Software\n         Solid State Recorder\n \n    Attitude Control Sub-system:\n \n    The Attiude Control Sub-system (ACS) controlled the orientation of\n    the orbiter as it traveled through space and maintained knowledge\n    of where celestial bodies were located -- for example, Earth and\n    the Sun. This knowledge was critical for the spacecraft to perform\n    the correct maneuvers to get to the Moon, to keep its solar arrays\n    pointed toward the Sun for battery charging, and to keep its\n    S-Band antenna pointed toward the Earth in order to maintain\n    communications.\n \n    Once in orbit around the Moon, the ACS also maintained constant\n    knowledge of where the spacecraft was in its orbit.\n \n    The Attitude Control sub-system provided three-axis stabilized\n    control and consisted of a sun sensor, a star tracker, reaction\n    wheels, and an inertial measurement unit.\n \n    Electrical Power:\n \n    The electrical power sub-system was responsible for generating,\n    storing, and distributing power to the orbiter systems. The\n    electrical power system included two solar arrays and a lithium\n    ion battery. Each solar array was capable of producing 700 watts\n    at the end of the mission. The arrays were deployed shortly after\n    separation from the launch vehicle and remained fixed throughout\n    the mission. Each battery had a capacity of 30 amp-hours and was\n    used to provide power when the spacecraft was in the Moon's\n    shadow.\n \n    Solar panels: The only source of replenishable power is sunlight.\n    Solar panels are mounted one side of each orbiter and capable in a\n    body-fixed position.\n \n    Thermal Sub-Systems:\n \n    The thermal sub-system maintained the right temperatures in all\n    parts of the spacecraft. It employed several conduction- and\n    radiation-based techniques for thermal control.  Its components\n    included:\n \n         Radiators\n         Surface coatings\n         Thermal blankets\n         Heaters\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n \n  Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation with elements\n  both on the spacecraft and at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).\n  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine\n  telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.\n \n  The Deep Space Network was a telecommunications facility managed by\n  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n  Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n  Administration.\n \n  The primary function of the DSN was to provide two-way\n  communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar\n  system.  To carry out this function the DSN was equipped with\n  high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and\n  appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n  The DSN consisted of three complexes situated at approximately\n  equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone\n  (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and\n  Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the complexes were\n  located in the northern hemisphere while the third was in the\n  southern hemisphere.\n \n  The network comprised four subnets, each of which included one\n  antenna at each complex.  The four subnets were defined according to\n  the properties of their respective antennas: 70-m diameter, standard\n  34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter, and 26-m diameter.\n \n  These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications\n  subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft, constituted the major\n  elements of instrumentation for radio science investigations.",

LM used two\n    system-level spacecraft test labs (STL) and one software simulator\n    (SoftSim) testbed with unlimited copies that enabled integration\n    and verification of all hardware and software throughout the\n    Assembly Test and Launch Operations (ATLO) cycle.\n \n    See [HOFFMAN2009] for more information about the spacecraft.\n \n    Spacecraft Configurations\n    -------------------------\n    During its mission, GRAIL needed to operate in four distinct\n    mission configurations.\n \n    Launch: During launch, the two spacecraft had to be fitted together\n    within the nose cone, or payload fairing, of the launch vehicle.\n    Large parts, such as the solar arrays, were designed to be folded\n    up.\n \n    Cruise: As soon as the two spacecraft were clear of the launch\n    vehicle, the body-fixed solar arrays were deployed to begin\n    producing power. The high-gain antenna also became operational.\n \n    Lunar Orbit Insertion: The lunar orbit insertion required numerous\n    maneuvers to circularize the two orbits. No science observations\n    took place, as the spacecraft were not in formation flying yet.\n \n    Science Operations: During the Science Phase, the two spacecraft\n    were placed in a precision formation flying configuration in order\n    to point to each other and exchange two radio links at Ka- and\n    S-bands.\n \n    Coordinate Systems\n    ------------------\n \n    Two coordinate systems are used to reference the various GRAIL\n    instruments. The definitions are summarized below.\n \n    1) Mechanical Frame (MF): This is defined by the spacecraft\n    manufacturer. It is the reference frame for such things as KBR\n    horn location, center of mass, and thruster locations.\n \n    +X = Parallel to, and in opposite direction from, the solar array\n    normal vector\n    +Z = Normal to star tracker bus plate\n    +Y = +Z ? +X\n \n    An onboard attitude control sub-system approximately orients the\n    mechanical frame with -Z along the line of flight and -/+ Y\n    pointed towards the moon.\n \n    2) Science Reference Frame (SRF): This is the Mechanical Frame as\n    realized by the Star Tracker. If the Star Tracker were perfectly\n    aligned, MF would equal SRF. SRF is the reference frame for GRAIL\n    science measurements.\n \n    Major Spacecraft Components\n    ---------------------------\n    Science Payload Instruments:\n \n    There are two payload elements on each GRAIL orbiter: the Lunar\n    Gravity Ranging System (LGRS) which is the science instrument, and\n    the MoonKAM lunar-imager which is used for Education and Public\n    Outreach. The LGRS is based on the instrument used for the Gravity\n    Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, which has been\n    mapping Earth's gravity since 2002. The LGRS is responsible for\n    sending and receiving the signals needed to accurately and\n    precisely measure the changes in range between the two orbiters.\n    The LGRS consists of an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO), Microwave\n    Assembly (MWA), a Time-Transfer Assembly (TTA), and the Gravity\n    Recovery Processor Assembly (GPA).\n \n    The USO provides a steady reference signal that is used by all of\n    the instrument subsystems. Within the LGRS, the USO provides the\n    reference frequency for the MWA and the TTA. The MWA converts the\n    USO reference signal to the Ka-band frequency, which is\n    transmitted to the other orbiter.\n \n    The function of the TTA is to provide a two-way time-transfer link\n    between the spacecraft to both synchronize and measure the clock\n    offset between the two LGRS clocks. The TTA generates an S-band\n    signal from the USO reference frequency and sends a GPS-like\n    ranging code to the other spacecraft. The GPA combines all the\n    inputs received from the MWA and TTA to produce the radiometric\n    data that are downlinked to the ground. In addition to acquiring\n    the inter-spacecraft measurements, the LGRS also provides a\n    one-way signal to the ground based on the USO, which is\n    transmitted via the X-band Radio Science Beacon (RSB). The\n    steady-state drift of the USO is measured via the one-way Doppler\n    data provided by the RSB.\n \n    The LGRS instrument is summarized below.\n \n         2 X-band beacon antennas for Doppler ranging measurements\n           when the spacecraft was visible from Earth. The X-band\n           signal was carrier-only and not\n         1 S-band time-transfer system antenna, which sent a\n           time-synchronization code back and forth between the\n           spacecraft\n         1 Ka-band ranging antenna for precision distance measurement\n           between the spacecraft\n \n    For more information on the GRAIL radio systems, see\n    [KLIPSTEINETAL2009].\n \n    Structures:\n \n    The solar panels and antennas were body fixed, so there were no\n    moving parts in the spacecraft structure that would affect science\n    observations.\n \n    Telecommunications Sub-System:\n \n    The telecom sub-system included the following on each spacecraft:\n \n         2 S-band transponder antennas to communicate with Earth\n \n    Each of the pairs of S-band transponder antennas had one antenna\n    mounted on the sunny side of the spacecraft and one mounted on the\n    dark side. The sunny-side antennas pointed to Earth during the\n    full moon and the dark-side antennas pointed to Earth during new\n    moon. This design obviated the need to mechanically rotate the\n    antennas during the mission, which would have moved the\n    spacecraft's center of mass with respect to the Ka-Band ranging\n    and X-Band beacon paths, disturbing the science measurements.\n \n    Propulsion Sub-System:\n \n    The propulsion sub-system on each spacecraft included:\n \n    A propellant tank, which could hold up to 103.5 kilograms of the\n    monopropellant hydrazine.\n \n    A hydrazine catalytic thruster for lunar-orbit insertion and\n    trajectory changes, and a warm-gas system with 8 thruster valves\n    for attitude control and other small maneuvers.\n \n    Command and Data-Handling Sub-System:\n \n    The C&DH sub-system controlled all spacecraft functions. This\n    system:\n \n         * managed all forms of data on the spacecraft;\n         * executed commands (including maneuver commands) sent from\n           Earth;\n         * prepared data for transmission to Earth;\n         * managed collection of solar power and charging of the\n           batteries;\n         * collected and processed information about all sub-systems\n           and payloads;\n         * kept and distributed the spacecraft time;\n         * calculated spacecraft position in orbit around the Moon;\n         * autonomously monitored and responded to any onboard\n           problems that occurred.\n \n    The key parts of this system were:\n \n         Space Flight Computer\n         Flight Software\n         Solid State Recorder\n \n    Attitude Control Sub-system:\n \n    The Attiude Control Sub-system (ACS) controlled the orientation of\n    the orbiter as it traveled through space and maintained knowledge\n    of where celestial bodies were located -- for example, Earth and\n    the Sun. This knowledge was critical for the spacecraft to perform\n    the correct maneuvers to get to the Moon, to keep its solar arrays\n    pointed toward the Sun for battery charging, and to keep its\n    S-Band antenna pointed toward the Earth in order to maintain\n    communications.\n \n    Once in orbit around the Moon, the ACS also maintained constant\n    knowledge of where the spacecraft was in its orbit.\n \n    The Attitude Control sub-system provided three-axis stabilized\n    control and consisted of a sun sensor, a star tracker, reaction\n    wheels, and an inertial measurement unit.\n \n    Electrical Power:\n \n    The electrical power sub-system was responsible for generating,\n    storing, and distributing power to the orbiter systems. The\n    electrical power system included two solar arrays and a lithium\n    ion battery. Each solar array was capable of producing 700 watts\n    at the end of the mission. The arrays were deployed shortly after\n    separation from the launch vehicle and remained fixed throughout\n    the mission. Each battery had a capacity of 30 amp-hours and was\n    used to provide power when the spacecraft was in the Moon's\n    shadow.\n \n    Solar panels: The only source of replenishable power is sunlight.\n    Solar panels are mounted one side of each orbiter and capable in a\n    body-fixed position.\n \n    Thermal Sub-Systems:\n \n    The thermal sub-system maintained the right temperatures in all\n    parts of the spacecraft. It employed several conduction- and\n    radiation-based techniques for thermal control.  Its components\n    included:\n \n         Radiators\n         Surface coatings\n         Thermal blankets\n         Heaters\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n \n  Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation with elements\n  both on the spacecraft and at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).\n  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine\n  telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.\n \n  The Deep Space Network was a telecommunications facility managed by\n  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n  Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n  Administration.\n \n  The primary function of the DSN was to provide two-way\n  communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar\n  system.  To carry out this function the DSN was equipped with\n  high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and\n  appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n  The DSN consisted of three complexes situated at approximately\n  equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone\n  (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and\n  Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the complexes were\n  located in the northern hemisphere while the third was in the\n  southern hemisphere.\n \n  The network comprised four subnets, each of which included one\n  antenna at each complex.  The four subnets were defined according to\n  the properties of their respective antennas: 70-m diameter, standard\n  34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter, and 26-m diameter.\n \n  These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications\n  subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft, constituted the major\n  elements of instrumentation for radio science investigations.",

The launch mass is 530 kg, including 50 kg of chemical propellant and 65 kg of xenon gas. Two solar panel wings with a total array area of 12 square meters protrude from the side and a 1.5 m diameter high-gain parabolic antenna is mounted on top on a two-axis gimbal. A cylindrical sampler horn, deployed shortly after launch, protrudes from the bottom of the spacecraft. The Minerva lander was also mounted on th spacecraft near the bottom panel. Hayabusa is propelled during cruise phases by two microwave ion thruster engines, which use a microwave discharge to ionize xenon gas. The ionized plasma is accelerated by high-voltage electrodes through four thruster heads which protrude from one side of the spacecraft body to provide a peak thrust of 20 mN using 1 kW power. A nitrogen tetroxide/hydrazine propulsion system with a peak thrust of 22 N will be used for maneuvering. The spacecraft is powered by gallium-arsenide solar cells and a 15 A-hr rechargeable nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery. Communications are via X- and S-band low gain antennas and the high gain dish antenna (X-band) with a transmitted power of 20 W. The mission is also be equipped with a camera, used for imaging, visible-polarimetry studies, and optical navigation near the asteroid, a laser ranging device (LIDAR), and near-IR and X-ray spectrometers. The insulated and cushioned re-entry capsule, 40 cm in diameter and 25 cm deep with a mass of about 20 kg, is attached to the body of the spacecraft near the sample collection horn. The capsule has a convex nose covered with a 3 cm thick ablative heat shield to protect the samples from the high velocity (~13 km/s) re-entry. Cost of the Hayabusa spacecraft is roughly 12 billion yen ($100 million U.S.)",

The\n    spacecraft is roughly 2.5 meters across and its mass is 465 kg\n    including propellant. Design features include 64 Gbits of redundant\n    solid-state data storage, a 290 m/s propulsion budget, and the\n    capability to transmit data from 32 AU at almost 1 kilobit/second.\n \n    The instrument payload [Stern & Cheng, 2002, STERN&CHENG2002]\n    comprises the two-sensor RALPH Vis-IR remote sensing package, the\n    ALICE UV imaging spectrometer, the REX radio/radiometry experiment,\n    the two-sensor PEPSSI/SWAP plasma suite, the LORRI long-focal-length\n    imager, and the SDC student-built dust counter.\n \n \n  Payload\n  =======\n    The New Horizons team selected instruments that not only directly\n    measure NASA-specified items of interest (NASA AO 01-OSS-01, 2001,\n    [NASAAO2001]), but also provide backup to other instruments on the\n    spacecraft should one fail during the mission.\n \n    The payload comprises seven instruments:\n \n \n    RALPH\n    -----\n      The main objectives for the RALPH instrument are to obtain high\n      resolution color maps and surface composition maps of the surfaces\n      of Pluto and Charon. The instrument has two separate channels: the\n      Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) and the Linear Etalon\n      Imaging Spectral Array (LEISA). A single telescope with a 3-inch\n      (6-centimeter) aperture collects and focuses the light used in both\n      channels.\n \n      RALPH/MVIC operates at visible wavelengths and has 4 different\n      filters for producing color maps. One filter allows measurement of\n      the methane frost distribution over the surface, while the others\n      are more generic and cover blue, red and near-infrared colors,\n      respectively. MVIC also has two panchromatic filters that pass\n      essentially all visible light.  This will be useful for low-light\n      level observations requiring maximum sensitivity.  In all cases,\n      the light passes from the telescope through the filters and is\n      focused onto a charge coupled device (CCD).\n \n      RALPH/LEISA operates at infrared wavelengths, and its etalon (a filter\n      with a narrow spectral bandpass that varies linearly in one dimension)\n      is bonded to the illuminated side of the IR detector.  As a result,\n      each row of detector pixels receives only light of a particular\n      wavelength.  Spectral maps are produced by sweeping the FOV of the\n      instrument across a scene, sequentially sampling each point in the\n      scene at each wavelength.  LEISA maps the distribution of frosts of\n      methane (CH4), molecular nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), and\n      water (H2O) over the surface of Pluto and the water frost\n      distribution over the surface of Charon.  LEISA data may also reveal\n      new constituents on the surfaces that have never before been detected.\n \n    ALICE\n    -----\n      Alice is an ultraviolet imaging spectrometer that probes the\n      atmospheric composition of Pluto.\n \n      Alice has two modes of operation: an airglow mode, which measures\n      emissions from atmospheric constituents, and an occultation mode,\n      which views either the Sun or a bright star through the atmosphere\n      producing absorption by the atmospheric constituents. The Alice\n      occultation mode occurs just after New Horizons passes behind Pluto\n      and looks back at the Sun through the Pluto atmosphere.\n \n \n    REX\n    ---\n      REX is an acronym for Radio EXperiment. It is integrated into the\n      New Horizons radio telecommunications system.\n \n      Using an occultation technique similar to that described above for\n      the Alice instrument, REX probes the Pluto atmosphere. After New\n      Horizons flies by Pluto, its 2.1 meter radio antenna points back at\n      Earth. On Earth, powerful radio transmitters in the NASA Deep Space\n      Network (DSN) point at New Horizons and send radio signals to the\n      spacecraft.  As the spacecraft passes behind Pluto, the atmosphere\n      bends the radio waves by an amount that depends on the average\n      molecular weight of the gas in the atmosphere, the atmospheric\n      temperature, and the closest approach distance of the raypath at\n      each instant of time. REX samples the received radio signal and\n      sends the data back to Earth for analysis\n \n      REX also has a radiometry mode, which measures the weak radio\n      thermal emission from Pluto itself. When REX looks back at Pluto\n      following the flyby, radiometry data are taken to derive a value for\n      the Pluto nightside temperature.\n \n \n    LORRI\n    -----\n      The instrument that provides the highest spatial resolution on New\n      Horizons is LORRI - short for LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager -\n      which comprises a telescope with a 20.8cm aperture that focuses\n      visible light onto a charge coupled device (CCD). LORRI has a very\n      simple design; there are no filters or moving parts. Near the time\n      of closest approach, LORRI takes images of the Pluto surface at 100m\n      resolution.\n \n \n    SWAP\n    ----\n      The Solar Wind Analyzer around Pluto (SWAP) instrument measures\n      charged particles from the solar wind near Pluto to determine\n      whether Pluto has a magnetosphere and how fast the atmosphere is\n      escaping.\n \n \n    PEPSSI\n    ------\n      Another plasma-sensing instrument, the Pluto Energetic Particle\n      Spectrometer Science Investigation (PEPSSI), searches for neutral\n      atoms that escape the Pluto atmosphere and subsequently become\n      charged by their interaction with the solar wind.\n \n    SDC\n    ---\n      The Student Dust Counter, which was later re-named The Venetia\n      Burney Student Dust Counter (SDC), is an Education and Public\n      Outreach project.  SDC measures the dust density of the\n      Interplanetary Dust Particles (IDP) by measuring the charge\n      generated in the SDC sensor from dust impact events.  From this may\n      be inferred the size and distribution of dust particles along the\n      entire New Horizons trajectory, including regions of interplanetary\n      space never before sampled.  Such dust particles are created by\n      comets shedding material and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) colliding\n      with other KBOs.  The SDC is managed and was built primarily by\n      students at the University of Colorado in Boulder, with supervision\n      from professional space scientists.\n \n \n  Spacecraft reference frame (a.k.a. Coordinate system)\n  =====================================================\n    During hibernation and other periods of inactivity, the spacecraft is\n    designed to spin about its +Y axis, which is also the nominal\n    boresight of the High Gain Antenna (HGA) and REX.  Imaging instruments\n    have nominal boresights pointing along the -X spacecraft axis.  The\n    RTG (see Power below) is a cylinder extending out along the +X\n    spacecraft axis to keep it away from the instruments.  The +Z axis\n    completes a right-handed three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate\n    system.  Note that each instrument has its own reference frame.\n \n    The following two sketches, extracted from the SPICE Frames kernel,\n    represent the spacecraft as viewed from the spacecraft +X and +Y\n    directions.  The instrument locations are approximate; refer to\n    [STERNETAL2008] and [FOUNTAINETAL2008] for more detail.\n \n \nSpacecraft sketches\n===================\n     +X view:\n     --------\n                                     o\n                                    /|\\\n                                   / | \\\n                                  /  |  \\\n                                 /   |   \\\n                                /    |    \\\n                               /     |     \\\n           ___________________/______|______\\__________________\n           `-.

The New Horizons mission operations team\n    communicates with the spacecraft through the Deep Space Network (DSN).\n    The DSN comprises facilities in the Mojave Desert in California; near\n    Madrid, Spain; and near Canberra, Australia.\n \n \n  Power\n  =====\n    Electrical power for the New Horizons spacecraft and science\n    instruments is provided by a single radioisotope thermoelectric\n    generator, or RTG, supplied by the Department of Energy.  The New\n    Horizons trajectory takes it more than 4 billion miles from Earth,\n    where light from the Sun is 1,000 times fainter than at Earth.  An RTG\n    is used on missions, such as New Horizons, that can not use solar\n    power - yet require a proven, reliable power supply that can produce\n    up to several kilowatts of power and operate under severe\n    environmental conditions for many years.\n \n    Carrying out the New Horizons mission safely is a top priority at\n    NASA. As part of that focus, NASA informed the public about use by New\n    Horizons of an RTG by publishing a detailed Environmental Impact\n    Statement - or EIS - and several fact sheets. The Final EIS, which\n    includes public comments on the Draft EIS and the NASA responses to\n    those comments, was released in July 2005.\n \n \n  Propulsion\n  ==========\n    The propulsion system (see [FOUNTAINETAL2008], section 3) includes\n    twelve 0.8N thrusters, four 4.4N thrusters, and the hydrazine\n    propellant tank and associated control valves. The titanium\n    propellant/pressurant tank feeds the thrusters through a system\n    filter, a flow control orifice, and a set of latch valves that prevent\n    flow of the fuel until commanded to the open position after launch.\n    Helium was selected as the tank pressurant instead of nitrogen to\n    allow the loading of an additional kilogram of hydrazine. Measurements\n    of tank pressure and temperatures at various points in the system\n    allow the mission operations team to monitor system performance and\n    the amount of fuel remaining in the tank.\n \n    The 16 rocket engine assemblies (REAs) are organized into 8 sets and\n    placed on the spacecraft as shown in Figure 5. Pairs of the 0.8N\n    thrusters (each thruster from a different set) are usually fired to\n    produce torques and control rotation about one of the three spacecraft\n    axes. The one exception to the use of coupled thruster firings to\n    control spacecraft rates is that of controlling rates about the\n    spacecraft X axis during science observations, where uncoupled\n    thruster firings are required to meet the maximum spacecraft drift\n    rates allowed during this operation mode. Control rates for each of\n    the spacecraft axes are shown below in Table II. One pair of the 4.4N\n    thrusters is aligned along the -Y spacecraft axis to provide delta-V\n    for large propulsive events such as trajectory correction maneuvers\n    (TCMs). The second pair of 4.4N thrusters is aligned to produce thrust\n    along the +Y axis. These thrusters are rotated 45 degrees in the YZ\n    plane to minimize the plume impingement on the HGA dish. The net\n    propulsive effect of these thrusters is therefore reduced. They still\n    provide the required redundancy and the ability to generate thrust in\n    both directions without a 180-degree rotation of the spacecraft.\n \n    Each thruster requires a heater to warm its catalyst bed to a minimum\n    temperature prior to use. Each thruster catalyst bed has both a\n    primary and a secondary heater element, with each element drawing\n    approximately 2.2 W of power. Control of the catalyst bed heater\n    circuits is grouped functionally by pairs (to minimize the number of\n    switches required), so that a total of 16 switches control the heater\n    elements, allowing great flexibility to operate the spacecraft safely\n    while drawing the minimum required power. Operational requirements for\n    catalyst bed heater\n \n    The pulse duration and total on-time of each thruster are commanded\n    very precisely, providing accurate control of the total impulse\n    generated during a maneuver. The 0.8N thrusters can be turned on for\n    periods as short as 5 ms. The initial propellant load was allocated\n    between primary mission TCMs, attitude control (including science and\n    communication operations), and primary mission margin. At the end of\n    the primary mission, sufficient margin may allow for an extended\n    mission to one or more objects in the Kuiper Belt. The original margin\n    was augmented during the final mission preparations when the unused\n    dry mass margin was converted to additional propellant.\n \n    Given the mass and moments of inertia at launch, the delta-V\n    propellant cost is approximately 4.9 m/s/kg. A change in spin rate of\n    5 rpm (i.e., the change from the nominal spin rate to zero rpm for\n    3-axis control mode) requires approximately 0.125 kg of hydrazine.\n \n \n    Propellant budget allocations\n    -----------------------------\n                                        delta-V   Propellant\n        Description                         m/s           kg\n        -----------------------------   -------   ----------\n        Primary mission TCM                 110         22.3\n        Attitude control                    N/A         29.3\n        Primary mission margin              132         25.2\n         - original margin allocation      ( 91)       (17.5)\n         - Additional margin obtained      ( 41)       (29.3)\n           from unused spacecraft dry\n           mass allocation\n        Total navigation delta-V            242\n        Total propellant load                           76.8",

The system was capable of measuring incident plasma distribution parameters over the energy range 0.1 to 18 keV for protons and approximately 1 to 500 eV for electrons. The high-resolution analyzer with a constant of 9 keV/Q per kV applied to the plates, had a mean plate radius of 9 cm and separation of 0.5 cm. This analyzer was used to measure ions only, and had 26 channeltrons mounted on the semicircular exit to the analyzer. The aperture pointed through a wide slit in the back of the spacecraft high-gain antenna reflector and pointed along the spin axis toward the earth (and therefore the sun). The edges of the antenna reflector limited the viewing of the instrument to 73 deg with respect to the spin axis. The channeltrons covered a range of plus or minus 51 deg. Each channeltron near the center covered 3 deg and approximately 8 deg near the edges of the analyzer. The angular width perpendicular to the long angular width was about 2 deg. In half the spin period the whole cone of half-angle 51 deg centered on the sun was swept out. A medium-energy analyzer with a mean radius of 12 cm and a 1-cm plate separation (constant of 6 keV/Q per kV applied) was used to detect both ions and electrons. The detectors were five flat-surface current collectors. The three center collectors each covered 15 deg and covered the angular range of plus or minus 22.5 deg from the spin axis. The two outside collectors had an angular width of 47.5 deg and were located at plus or minus 46.25 deg from the center of the analyzer. There was a variety of possible operating modes for the experiment; however, the principal mode utilized during the encounter phase was one in which the analyzer plate potential was stepped through its range every one-half revolution of the spacecraft, and all current collectors or channeltrons were read out at the peak flux roll angle. The high and medium resolution analyzers operated independently, so a cross check between these analyzers was possible. The dynamic range for the particle fluxes was from 1.0E+2 to 3.0E+9/(sq cm-s) and the proton temperature down to 2.0E+3 deg K could be ascertained. Data include the interplanetary region.

	"display_description": "This experiment consisted of an array of five particle detectors with electron thresholds in the range .01 to 35 MeV and proton thresholds in the range 0.15 to 80 MeV. A Cerenkov counter (C) had four output channels (C1, C2, C3, and CDC) sensitive to electrons having energies above 6, 9, 13, and 1 MeV, respectively. An electron-scatter counter (E) had three output channels (E1, E2, and E3) sensitive to electrons above .16, .26, and .46 MeV. A minimum ionization counter (M) had three output channels, M1 sensitive to electrons having energies greater than 35 MeV, M2 that measured background, and M3 that was sensitive to protons having energies greater than 80 MeV. The last two sensors were scintillator detectors (SP and SE), both of which had energy thresholds of 10 keV for electrons and 150 keV for protons. The sensitivity of the SE detector to protons was about a factor of 10 lower than its sensitivity to electrons. Thus, the SEDC channel effectively measured the electron flux, which could then be subtracted from the SPDC channel response to obtain the proton flux. Several other channels, listed above, required corrections to obtain the fluxes of the species indicated. Three of the channels (CDC, SPDC, and SEDC) were read out through a common electrometer. Due to a malfunction that occurred between launch and Jovian encounter, these three channels produced no usable encounter data. The detector channels could be programmed for readout in any one of four patterns at each of the eight spacecraft bit rate modes. During encounter when the spacecraft was operating in the highest bit rate mode, the minimum time to sample one channel was 1.5 s and the time to obtain a complete scan through all channels was 108 s. Since the directional detectors pointed perpendicular to the spin axis and the spin rate was 5 rpm, pitch-angle measurements were obtained. While the experiment was primarily designated for encounter studies, some data were obtained at low rates in interplanetary space. The last data were taken on December 1, 1993, after which the instrument was turned off to conserve power for other spacecraft experiments and systems.A description of the instrumentation and initial Pioneer 10 results was published in J.

The maximum resolution achievable depended on the actual trajectory on this multi-encounter mission, but the resolution was as high as 0.5 to 1.0 km on the closest approaches to some objects. At Jupiter and Saturn, the resolution was better than 20 km and 5 km, respectively. The objectives of the experiment were to photograph global motions and cloud distributions on Jupiter and Saturn, gross dynamical properties, zonal rotation, orientation of spin axis, zonal shear, vertical shear, flow instabilities, spots, and spectrum of scale of atmospheric motions in time and space. Additional objectives included the study of the mode of release of internal energy flux (search for convection cells and rolls), study of growth, dissipation, morphology, and vertical structure of cloud complexes, gross optical properties, global and localized scattering function in the visible spectrum, polarimetry, nature of chromophores (their structure and development), and high resolution of the Great Red Spot. The objectives of the satellite encounters included the following: (1) gross characteristics (size, shape, rotation, spin axis, cartography, improved ephemerides, and masses), (2) geology (major physiographic provinces, impact and volcanic features, lineaments, polar caps, erosion processes, low- and high-density satellite comparative studies, detection of atmospheres, frosts, and limb stratification of aerosols), and (3) surface properties (colorimetry, scattering function, nature of brightness variation, and search for new satellites). Studies of Saturn's rings included (1) resolution of individual ring components or clumps of material, (2) vertical and radial distribution of material at very high resolution, (3) scattering function, (4) coarse polarimetry, (5) occultation - optical depth, and (6) distinguishing different types of material in the rings. Other objectives were to search for new comets, asteroids, and targets of opportunity.",

Vertical temperature profiles were obtained on the planets and satellites with atmospheres. Studies of the composition, thermal properties, and size of particles in Saturn's rings were conducted. The interferometer had a spectral range of approximately 180 to 2500 1/cm (4-55 micrometers), while the radiometer range covered the spectra from approximately 5000 to 30000 1/cm (0.33-2 micrometers). The nominal apodized spectral resolution of the interferometer was 4.3 1/cm. The instruments shared a half-meter Cassegrain telescope with a 0.25-deg field of view. The basic quantity measured was the spectral radiance of emitted and reflected IR radiation and a large fraction of reflected visible energy. The interferometer was calibrated using deep space (assumed to be a black body at 0 deg K) and the internal instrument temperature as reference points. The radiometer was calibrated with a diffuser plate of known radiometric properties. For a description of the instrument see Hanel, R. et al., 1977, Applied Optics, v. 19, p. 1391.",

Measurement of material sputtered from the satellites and the rings by magnetospheric charged particle and micrometeorite bombardment is expected to provide information about the formation of the giant neutral cloud of water molecules and water products that surrounds Saturn out to a distance of ~12 planetary radii and about the genesis and evolution of the rings.",

	"display_description": "Sunlight plays a key role in driving many important physical processes in planetary physics. Absorption of UV light drives photochemical reactions, leading to changes in atmospheric composition and the production of atmospheric aerosols. The size, shape, composition and distribution of aerosols and cloud particles determine their optical properties and their ability to absorb sunlight and emit thermal infrared radiation. Thus they play a key role in the atmosphere's thermal balance. The net radiative heating or cooling rate provides the forcing for atmospheric dynamics, which in turn can affect the distribution of aerosol and cloud particles and influence climate. The composition, thermal balance, dynamics and meteorology of the atmosphere also affect (and are affected by) the nature of the surface. Surface images in reflected sunlight, together with near-IR reflection spectra, can reveal the nature of the surface and its interactions with atmospheric processes. Optical measurements of solar radiation made inside a planetary atmosphere can thus reveal a great deal about many important physical processes occurring there. The Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer (DISR) is the optical instrument aboard Huygens that makes measurements at solar wavelengths. It was developed in a collaborative effort by scientists from the US, France and Germany. DISR measures solar radiation using silicon photodiodes, a 2D silicon Charge Coupled Device (CCD) detector and two InGaAs near-IR linear array detectors. Fibre optics connect the detectors to many separate sets of foreoptics that collect light from different directions and in different spectral regions. In this way, the instrument can collect a suite of measurements that are carefully selected to answer key questions concerning the nature of Titan's surface and the composition, meteorology, thermal balance and clouds and aerosols in Titan's atmosphere.",

Channel 1 covers 4.0 to 14.3 microns, detected\n      by a HgGe detector at 22K, cooled by a Joule-Thomson cryostat.\n      Channel 2 covers 1.9-6.0 microns; detection is by a PbSe\n      detector at 175K, with radiative cooling.  Wavelength\n      resolution is 0.5-1.0%.\n \n      The filters were each comprised of two semicircular filters\n      bonded together and accompanied by a matching set of blocking\n      filters.  Thus one rotation of the wheel covered roughly n to\n      2n and 2n to 4n in wavelength space.  The spectral resolution\n      varied between 0.7 to 1.1%.  Two 'radiometer' slots were\n      produced between the filter segments, twice per revolution, by\n      rotating the blocking filter 0.01 degrees of arc relative to\n      the CVF, allowing broadband light to fall on the detectors.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The IR Spectrometers were intended to determine the composition\n      of the Mars atmosphere, including minor constituents.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      It appears that the rate of rotation of the filter wheels is\n      somewhat variable, producing a 'stretching' effect in the data.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      Pre-flight calibration of the IRS instruments consisted of\n      obtaining spectra of blackbody sources at varying temperatures\n      in the range 77-300K, as well as absorption spectra of NH3,\n      CH4, H20, CO2, and polystyrene with a high-temperature source.\n      During flight, spectra were obtained periodically of a\n      reference thermal target and of polystyrene superimposed on the\n      Mars spectrum.  Refer to the instrument paper.  Several\n      blackbody calibration spectra at various target temperatures\n      are available in the data file; they are the first spectra in\n      the set, flagged by having negative spectrum numbers.\n \n \n    Section 'CH1'\n    =============\n      Total Fovs                     : 1\n      Data Rate                      : UNK\n      Sample Bits                    : UNK\n \n \n      'CH1' Detectors\n      ---------------\n        CH1\n \n \n      'CH1' Electronics\n      -----------------\n        IRS\n \n \n      'CH1' Filters\n      -------------\n        LONGWAVE\n \n \n      'CH1' Section Optic IDs\n      -----------------------\n        IRS\n \n \n      In modes\n      --------\n        OPERATING\n \n \n      'CH1' Section FOV Shape 'RECTANGULAR'\n      -------------------------------------\n        Section Id                     : CH1\n        Fovs                           : 1\n        Horizontal Fov                 : 0.100000\n        Vertical Fov                   : 2.070000\n \n \n      'CH1' Section Parameter 'SPECTRAL INTENSITY'\n      --------------------------------------------\n        The spectral 'Y axis' is proportional to raw instrument\n        output, and therefore does not correspond to physical units\n        such as radiance.

The modulated signal from each detector was fed directly\n        to its preamp, which contained the detector bias circuit.\n        The preamp input stage was an FET designed to provide high\n        gain and low noise.  The amplifiers were operated with both\n        ac and dc feedback so that the gain and bandwidth would be\n        relatively insensitive to internal component changes.\n        Following the preamp were a synchronous filter, demodulator,\n        log converter, output amplifier, science data multiplexer,\n        and data analog to pulse width converter.  For additional\n        information, please refer to the instrument description\n        reference: Applied Optics, 1972, 'Mariner Mars 1969 IR\n        Spectrometer, vol.  11, p.  493'\n \n \n    Instrument Filter '1 - LONGWAVE'\n    ================================\n      Filter Name                    : LONGWAVE\n      Filter Type                    : CIRCULAR-VARIABLE INTERFERENCE\n      Minimum Wavelength             : 3.900000\n      Maximum Wavelength             : 14.400000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        Wavelength calibration information in flight was derived from\n        observations of polystyrene film, which has many absorption\n        features in the range of interest.  The polystyrene spectrum\n        was superimposed on the target (Mars) spectrum each 12th\n        time.  Unfortunately, these spectra are unavailable at the\n        present time in digital form.  The spikes that occur in all\n        the spectra are introduced by allowing broadband radiation\n        onto the detector at certain rotational positions of the\n        circular variable filters.  Ostensibly, these spikes\n        represent wavelength fiduciaries.  Thus, for Mariner 7, the\n        first spike is at 3.86 microns, the middle spike at 7.88.\n        The longwave segment of CHANNEL 1 uses the middle spike as\n        7.37 microns and the third spike as 14.45.  However, it will\n        be found that the spikes do not relate reproducibly to the\n        locations of atmospheric CO2 features; there is a small\n        jitter in the relative locations.  Wavelength information can\n        also be derived from the known positions of these CO2\n        atmospheric features in the Mars data; this is probably the\n        most accurate and dependable scheme.  The supplier has\n        generated coefficients that describe a linear fit to the\n        wavelength scale, based on atmospheric features and the\n        spikes.  These appear in the headers for each spectrum.  Note\n        that the quality of the coefficients is variable and depends\n        on the noise level and the method chosen for that spectrum.\n \n        Refer to the instrument paper in Applied Optics for figures\n        showing the wavelength variation of filter transmission and\n        spectral resolution.\n \n \n    Instrument Filter '2 - SHORTWAVE'\n    =================================\n      Filter Name                    : SHORTWAVE\n      Filter Type                    : CIRCULAR-VARIABLE INTERFERENCE\n      Minimum Wavelength             : 1.880000\n      Maximum Wavelength             : 6.000000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        Wavelength calibration information in flight was derived from\n        observations of polystyrene film, which has many absorption\n        features in the range of interest.

The field of view is also\n    circular, with an angular diameter of approximately 4.4 degrees.\n    The effective spectral range of the interferometer is 200-2000\n    cm**-1, and the apodized spectral resolution is 2.4 cm**-1.  The\n    dwell time for each interferogram is 18.2 s.  An\n    image-motion-compensating mirror, inclined at an angle of 45\n    degrees to the axis of rotation, is part of the instrument;\n    however, it was never used for motion compensation.  The beam\n    splitter of the interferometer consists of a multilayer\n    dielectric coating applied to a CsI substrate.  The moving\n    mirror mounted on one end of a motor shaft is driven at a\n    constant velocity of 0.0235 cm/s during the recording of an\n    interferogram.  The fringe-control/reference interferometer uses\n    the same moving mirror, beamsplitter and fixed mirror, but a\n    different optical path than the IR signal, making use of the\n    center of the beamsplitter.  The center of the beamsplitter is\n    coated to perform well in the visible and near-infrared for the\n    reference interferometer.  A 0.6929 micrometer neon line source\n    is used for the reference interferometer with a photomultiplier\n    detector.  The signal from this unit, along with a velocity\n    transducer, provides feedback control of the main\n    interferometer, and as an initiator for the analog to digital\n    conversion process.  Synchronization of the data stream with the\n    spacecraft clock is accomplished by a phased locked loop which\n    slaves the mirror motion to the highly stable clock frequency.\n    The main IR detector is a thermister bolometer operating at 250\n    K with a bias voltage of 500 V.  The entrance window of the\n    instrument is also CsI to permit operation to 200 cm**-1.  The\n    window seals the interferometer from moisture and dust, and it\n    supports an optical filter designed to reflect sunlight and\n    thermal radiation below 2500 cm**-1.  The filter also protected\n    the CsI window from atmospheric degradation during storage and\n    launch.  Calibration is provided by alternatively viewing deep\n    space and a built-in blackbody maintained at a temperature of\n    296.4 K (see instrument calibration description) by rotation of\n    the image motion compensation mirror.  The dynamic range of the\n    instrument is 8000:1 with an NER (noise equivalent radiance) of\n    0.5 x 10**-7 W cm**-2 sr**-1/cm**-1.\n \n    The temperature of the instrument is passively and actively\n    controlled to operate at a nominal temperature of 250.0 +/- 0.2\n    K.  One surface of the instrument is not covered by thermal\n    insulation; it acts as a passive radiator to deep space.  Active\n    thermal control is maintained by the action of thermostatically\n    controlled heaters.  The thermostat kept the IRIS optical module\n    temperature constant to within +/- 0.2 K from the time of the\n    initial cooldown prior to launch, through the transit phase, and\n    during orbital operation at Mars [HANEL_ETAL_1972A,\n    HANEL_ETAL_1972B, HANEL_ETAL_1972C].\n \n \n  Scientific Objectives\n  =====================\n    The scientific objectives of the Mariner 9 Infrared\n    Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) investigation include the\n    following:\n \n    (1) Determination of the carbon dioxide pressure at the surface.\n    (2) Determination of the vertical temperature profile of the\n        atmosphere.\n    (3) Determination of the total amount of atmospheric water\n        vapor.\n    (4) Identification and determination of the abundances of other\n        minor atmospheric constituents.\n    (5) Determination of surface temperatures.\n    (6) Determination of chemical or mineralogical composition and\n        information of the physical structure of the surface layer,\n        including polar deposits.\n \n    These objectives are accomplished through the analysis of\n    measurements of thermal emission spectra.\n \n \n  Calibration\n  ===========\n    Calibration spectra were periodically recorded while observing\n    either deep space or an on-board warm blackbody (T = 296.4 K).\n    One pair of calibration spectra is generated for every 14\n    spectra of Mars (7 spectra of Mars, on-board black-body, 7\n    spectra of Mars, deep space, etc.).  Scaling of the raw Martian\n    spectra to the calibration spectra specifies the Martian spectra\n    in absolute radiometric units.  The calibration procedure for\n    the Mariner 9 spectra is similar to that previously described\n    for Nimbus 4, see HANEL_ETAL_1972D.  The excellent thermal\n    stability of the Mariner 9 IRIS permitted the entire ensemble of\n    1766 calibration pairs acquired during the Mariner mission to be\n    averaged to provide a single set of calibration parameters.\n    Consequently, the random error introduced into the individual\n    target spectra from calibration is extremely small.\n \n    The calibration is carried out independently for each wavenumber\n    interval by using the equation I = B(Tw) * (C1 - C2) / A1 / (C3\n    - C2), where C1 = the instantaneous spectral amplitude for Mars,\n    C2 = the average of the spectral amplitudes for the cold\n    calibration source (deep space), and C3 = the average of the\n    spectral amplitudes for the warm calibration source (on-board\n    reference blackbody).  B(Tw) is the Planck function for the\n    temperature of the warm reference blackbody (Tw).  Tw is an\n    average of eight transducer measurements made immediately before\n    and after each interferogram.  A1 is the reciprocal value of the\n    emissivity of the black paint used in the warm calibration\n    source, an aluminum plate with 30 degree V-shaped grooves\n    painted with 3M 401-C10 Black Velvet paint.  While this paint is\n    relatively black over most of the instrument spectral range,\n    small glass beads contained in it give rise to emittance\n    variations of a few percent near 480 cm**-1 and 1100 cm**-1\n    which are characteristic wave numbers of silicon dioxide.  The\n    correction factor was derived from laboratory reflectance\n    measurements on a duplicate blackbody, from similar measurements\n    on the same type of paint, kindly made available by James\n    Aronson (private communication), and finally from comparisons of\n    the warm and cold calibrations of the interferometer while in\n    orbit around Mars.  All three methods were in agreement;\n    consequently, the emissivity correction of the warm calibration\n    source has been applied to all spectra.  The emissivity of the\n    reference 'blackbody' is listed below:\n \n    Wave                          Wave\n    Number         Emissivity     Number         Emissivity\n    (cm**-1)       (cm**-1)\n    370            1.00           1000           0.98\n    375            1.00           1005           0.98\n    380            1.00           1010           0.97\n    385            1.00           1015           0.97\n    390            1.00           1020           0.96\n    395            0.99           1025           0.96\n    400            0.99           1030           0.96\n    405            0.99           1035           0.95\n    410            0.99           1040           0.95\n    415            0.99           1045           0.94\n    420            0.98           1050           0.94\n    425            0.98           1055           0.94\n    430            0.98           1060           0.94\n    435            0.97           1065           0.93\n    440            0.97           1070           0.93\n    445            0.96           1075           0.93\n    450            0.96           1080           0.92\n    455            0.95           1085           0.92\n    460            0.95           1090           0.92\n    465            0.95           1095           0.92\n    470            0.95           1100           0.91\n    475            0.95           1105           0.91\n    480            0.96           1110           0.91\n    485            0.97           1115           0.92\n    490            0.98           1120           0.92\n    495            0.99           1125           0.92\n    500            0.99           1130           0.93\n    505            0.99           1135           0.94\n    510            1.00           1140           0.95\n    515            1.00           1145           0.96\n    520            1.00           1150           0.96\n    .              .              1155           0.97\n    .              .              1160           0.98\n    .              .              1165           0.98\n    945            1.00           1170           0.98\n    950            1.00           1175           0.99\n    955            1.00           1180           0.99\n    960            0.99           1185           0.99\n    965            0.99           1190           0.99\n    970            0.99           1195           0.99\n    975            0.99           1200           0.99\n    980            0.99           1205           1.00\n    985            0.99           1210           1.00\n    990            0.98           1215           1.00\n    995            0.98           1220           1.00\n \n    The responsivity of the instrument and a spectral instrument\n    temperature may also be derived from each calibration pair.  The\n    noise equivalent spectral radiance (NESR), a measure of the\n    random errors in the measurements, is calculated from the\n    standard deviation of the individual instantaneous\n    responsivities.  The derivation and description of all the\n    instrumental parameters are discussed in detail in\n    HANELETAL1972D. Reference, responsivity, noise, and instrument\n    temperature spectra are included in the auxiliary data of the\n    MARINER9-MARS-IRIS-3-RDR-V1.0 dataset.  Small, narrow spikes are\n    present in the instrument NESR at the following locations:\n \n    nu(cm-1)      f(Hz)         Probable Source\n    ----------------------------------------------------\n     356.          8.36         8-1/3 bps-telemetry rate\n     713.         16.76         2 (8-1/3)\n    1069.         25.12         4 (8-1/3)\n    1203.         28.27         Unknown\n    1426.         33.52         4 (8-1/3) & 33-1/3\n    1782.         41.88         5 (8-1/3)\n \n    The most probable sources of most of these spikes are transients\n    caused by the engineering telemetry channels which have\n    characteristic frequencies of 8-1/3 and 33-1/3 bps.  The source\n    of the interference at 28.27 Hz is unknown.\n \n    In addition to the radiometric calibration, a wave number\n    correction has been applied to the data.  The finite solid\n    angles of the primary and reference interferometers cause a\n    small wave number shift and a distortion of the true wave number\n    scale.  This well known effect, caused by the interference of\n    on-axis and off-axis rays, has been corrected for empirically.\n    A numerical fit of a Lorentzian function was made to determine\n    the center wave number position nu_m and nu_t of the strongest\n    carbon dioxide features in a measured and in a theoretical\n    spectrum, respectively.  The correction adopted to provide the\n    theoretical wave number scale is nu_t = (0.016187 + nu_m) /\n    1.0010602.  This adjustment has been incorporated in the\n    calculation of the wave number mesh for the calibrated\n    radiances.\n \n \n  Operational Considerations\n  ==========================\n    The Mariner 9 IRIS instrument operated normally throughout the\n    mission.  As discussed in the Instrument Calibration\n    Description, the excellent thermal stability of the Mariner 9\n    IRIS permitted the entire ensemble of 1766 calibration pairs\n    acquired during the Mariner mission to be averaged to provide a\n    single set of calibration parameters.  Consequently, the random\n    error introduced into the individual target spectra from the\n    calibration is extremely small.  However, a detailed analysis of\n    emission angle pairs of spectra has determined that there may be\n    a very minor calibration error due to a small spike in one of\n    the calibration interferograms.  Additionally, for spectra taken\n    of areas with extremely low temperatures the NESR dominates at\n    high wavenumbers causing the calculated brightness temperatures\n    to increase with increasing wavenumber.\n \n \n  Instrument Detectors\n  ====================\n    The detector of the infrared interferometer is a thermister\n    bolometer operating at 250 K with a bias voltage of 500 V.\n \n \n  Instrument Electronics\n  ======================\n    The bulk of the analog and all of the digital circuitry is in an\n    electronics module located in the support base for the\n    interferometer module.  The parity and summation electronics are\n    in a separate box attached to the support base electronics\n    module.  The primary and standby power supplies and the\n    interface chassis are part of the Mariner octagonal spacecraft\n    bus structure.  The electronics box contains timing and control\n    elements, mirror drive circuitry, housekeeping monitors, thermal\n    controllers, and analog-to-digital converters.\n \n \n  Instrument Optics\n  =================\n    All mirrors of the interferometer are gold coated.  The fixed\n    interferometer mirror is the entrance pupil for the optical\n    system.  It has an effective circular aperture of 3.5 cm\n    diameter.  An ellipsoidal mirror collects the energy from the\n    interferometer and focuses it onto the infrared detector, a\n    thermister bolometer, which serves as the exit pupil.\n \n \n  Instrument Offset\n  =================\n    The instrument and the associated electronics modules are bolted\n    to the scan platform.  The primary and standby power supplies\n    and the interface chassis are part of the octagonal electronics\n    rack of the spacecraft.  The instrument is approximately\n    bore-sighted with the television camera, ultraviolet\n    spectrometer and infrared radiometer.\n \n \n  Instrument Parameters\n  =====================\n    Thermal Radiance (W cm-2 ster-1/cm-1).\n \n \n  Instrument Modes\n  ================\n    The instrument possesses only one operating mode.  When turned\n    on the instruments acquires one interferogram every 21 second\n    data frame.",

	"display_description": "Instrument Overview\n  ===================\n    Each Viking Lander had identical Labeled Release (LR) instruments\n    that used two solid-state beta detectors (Geiger counters) to\n    measure the release of radioactive gas from samples of martian\n    soil that had been inoculated with an aqueous nutrient solution.\n    The instrument contained additional sensors to measure headspace\n    (i.e, the volume of test chamber above the sample) and detector\n    temperatures.  Heaters were also included in the LR instrument\n    for the detectors and test chambers.  A number of published\n    papers describe the characteristics and performance of the LR\n    instrument.  The scientific rationale and early design of the\n    instrument are described in LEVIN1972 and a detailed description\n    of the flight module is given in LEVIN&STRAAT1976A.  A summary of\n    the information from these papers is given here as a high-level\n    description of the LR instrument and its operation.  The Labeled\n    Release instrument was part of a package of three biology\n    experiments on the Viking Landers [KLEIN1974].\n \n \n  Science Objectives\n  ==================\n    The major scientific objectives of the Viking Lander biology\n    investigation were to detect the plausibility and/or presence of\n    life on Mars.  In particular, the LR experiment was designed to\n    detect microbial life in the martian soil.  The Labeled Release\n    experiment tested for heterotrophic metabolism by monitoring the\n    release of radioactive gases from a soil sample inoculated with\n    carbon-14 labeled organic substrates.  The experiment also was\n    designed to analyze control samples that were heat sterilized.\n \n    Several assumptions were used in the design and operation of the\n    Labeled Release experiment.  These assumptions included the\n    following: A) life on Mars was carbon based; B) one or more of\n    the nutrient compounds would be metabolized by possible microbial\n    life; and C) one end product of metabolism would be a carbon\n    based gas.\n \n \n  LR Detailed Description\n  =======================\n    The Labeled Release instrument contained four incubation test\n    cells mounted on a carousel.  Each test cell could be rotated and\n    sealed beneath an assembly that contained a heater, plumbing\n    terminals for nutrient delivery and gas removal, and a tube\n    leading to the beta detectors.  Gas and nutrient moving through\n    the plumbing system were controlled by eight miniaturized\n    solenoid valves.  The headspace was connected to the two\n    solid-state beta detectors through a tube bent at several spots.\n    The connecting tube was bent to prevent radioactive particles\n    from reaching the detectors from the test cell.  The instrument\n    also had two temperature sensors.  One sensor measured the\n    temperature of the detectors and the other measured the\n    temperature of the headspace within the test cell.  For a\n    schematic and photographs of the Labeled Release instrument see\n    LEVIN&STRAAT1976A.\n \n    The Labeled Release nutrient was stored in a sealed glass ampoule\n    within a reservoir.  The reservoir, in turn, was connected to the\n    test cells by the instrument plumbing system.  The ampoule\n    containing the nutrient was broken by a mechanical striker driven\n    by high pressure helium shortly after the spacecraft landed on\n    the surface of Mars.  Low pressure helium was then bubbled\n    through the nutrient in the reservoir for several hours in order\n    to degas the nutrient.  At the start of an analysis cycle high\n    pressure helium was used to route a portion of the nutrient into\n    a sealed test cell.  Testing prior to launch indicated that 0.115\n    cc +/- 8% of nutrient was delivered during each injection.  The\n    pressure in the test cell headspace was kept above Mars ambient\n    atmospheric pressure with helium from the plumbing system to\n    prevent boiling of the nutrient.  The total pressure at the start\n    of an analysis cycle was about 9200 Pa (92 millibar).  At the end\n    of an analysis cycle, radioactive gas was purged from the test\n    cell through the plumbing system.\n \n    The LR instrument had two identical solid-state beta detectors\n    (Geiger counters) to monitor the evolved radioactive gas from the\n    soil sample.  There were two detectors as a contingency against\n    failure of one detector.  The detectors continuously counted\n    gaseous radioactivity as it evolved from the test cell.  The\n    instrument could be commanded to count with either one or both\n    detectors.  Detectors were referred to as the right and left\n    channels.  The Viking Landers were powered by radioisotope\n    thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which provided background\n    radiation to the detectors.  As a result, this background signal\n    had to be determined by monitoring the detectors for one to\n    several Mars days before nutrient was injected into a test cell.\n \n    The test cell heaters were used in a number of ways.  Samples\n    could be heated in the test cell prior to nutrient injections to\n    provide sterilized control samples.  During an analysis cycle the\n    test cell was heated to prevent the temperature from falling\n    below 9-10 degree C during the martian night.  The heater was\n    also used at the end of an analysis cycle to dry the sample.\n \n    The Labeled Release instrument shared common support services\n    with the other biology instruments.  This included the sample\n    delivery system [KLEIN1974].  Martian soil samples were collected\n    by the Viking Lander surface sampler arm [MOOREETAL1987;\n    CROUCH1977].  Soil from the sampler arm was dumped into a hopper\n    on top of the lander.  The hopper contained a sieve that only\n    allowed particles less than 2 mm in size to enter the instrument\n    test cells.  The sieved samples entered a distribution assembly\n    that automatically delivered measured volumes of soil to each\n    biology experiment [KLEIN1974].  The Labeled Release instrument\n    typically received 0.5 cc of soil.\n \n    The Biology common support services and the Labeled Release\n    instrument held enough nutrient and helium to conduct up to two\n    injections on four soil samples.  Testing prior to launch showed\n    that after proper drying of a soil sample and purging of gases\n    from a test cell that the cell could be used a second time by\n    adding more soil and nutrient.  One of the test cells on Viking\n    Lander 2 was used a second time.\n \n \n  Nutrient Description\n  ====================\n    Considerable effort went into selecting, preparing, and testing\n    the nutrients for the Label Release experiment\n    [LEVIN&STRAAT1976A].  Selection criteria were partially based on\n    the assumption that life evolved similarly on Mars as on Earth.\n    There were several criteria used in selecting compounds for the\n    nutrient that included: A) Compounds that were likely to be\n    produced on Mars; B) Compounds that primitive organisms were\n    likely to use in metabolism based on terrestrial analogs; and C)\n    Compounds that were unlikely to have nonbiological reactions with\n    martian soil.  In addition, each compound in the nutrient was\n    tested to show that it produced a rapid response in a variety of\n    terrestrial soils and in cultures of several types of organisms.\n    The stability of the materials was also considered given that the\n    nutrient was stored for about 2 years from the time it was\n    prepared until it was used on Mars.  The storage period included\n    the nearly one year cruise phase of the spacecraft on its journey\n    to Mars.  Nutrient material also had to undergo sterilization of\n    the biology module (54 hr at 120 degree C) and the entire\n    spacecraft (20 hr at 100 degree C).  It was expected that some\n    decomposition (<1%) of the nutrient would occur due to the long\n    storage time and sterilization.  Any radioactive carbon dioxide\n    produced by the nutrient decomposition was removed by flushing\n    the nutrient reservoir with helium before the first injection.  A\n    complete list of nutrient compounds is given in\n    LEVIN&STRAAT1976A.  The nutrient included sodium formate, calcium\n    glycolate, glycine, D- and L-alanine, sodium D-lactate and sodium\n    L-lactate.  The concentrations of each nutrient component were\n    dilute in case any particular compound was toxic to possible\n    martian organisms.  Each compound in the nutrient was labeled\n    with a precise amount of radioactive carbon-14.\n \n \n  Operation and Sampling Modes\n  ============================\n    The basic analysis cycle for the Labeled Release experiment was\n    to have a sample of martian soil delivered to a test cell and to\n    be moistened with an aqueous solution of carbon-14 labeled\n    organic media.  A second nutrient injection was typically done\n    about 7-8 Mars days after the first injection.  The headspace\n    above the sample was monitored continuously for evolved\n    radioactive gas as evidence for metabolism.  Viking Lander 1\n    completed four cycles, whereas Viking Lander 2 completed five\n    cycles for a total of nine cycles between the two landers.  VL2\n    cycle 5 was performed in a previously used test cell using a\n    stored portion of the cycle 4 soil sample.  Eight of the cycles\n    received two injections of nutrient.  VL1 cycle 3 received three\n    injections of nutrient.\n \n    Three of the analysis cycles were control cycles where the soil\n    sample was heated for several hours before nutrient injection.\n    The control cycle for Viking Lander 1 was heated to 160 degree C.\n    After receiving highly attenuated results from Viking Lander 1,\n    Viking Lander 2 control cycles were modified to be 50 degree C.\n \n    Radioactivity was counted for 16-minute intervals during an\n    analysis cycle, except for several hours around the time of\n    nutrient injection where intervals of 2- to 4-minutes were used.\n    Background levels were determined by measuring the test cell for\n    several Mars days prior to nutrient injection.  The headspace and\n    detector temperatures were measured every 16 minutes throughout\n    an analysis cycle.\n \n    At the end of the cycle, the radioactive gas was removed by\n    purging and the soil was dried by brief heating to prevent\n    evaporation upon opening the cell.  A fresh test cell was then\n    rotated beneath the head end assembly and a three-hour cleanup\n    was accomplished by heating both the head assembly and detectors\n    during continuous helium purging.  After cooling, trapped\n    nutrient was vented from the system.\n \n    The instrument was fairly automated with preprogrammed sequences.\n    Commands could be sent from the ground to change the\n    preprogrammed sequences to perform nutrient injections, to select\n    active or control sequences, to select a fresh soil sample, and\n    to initiate or terminate an analysis cycle.  Commands could be\n    sent to conduct single or double channel counting.\n \n \n  Principal Investigator\n  ======================\n    The principal investigator for the Viking Lander Labeled Release\n    experiment was Dr.  Gilbert V.  Levin of Biospherics, Inc.  Much\n    of the work on selecting the nutrient was directed by\n    Co-Investigator Dr.  Patricia Ann Straat.",

The VMIS\n      consists of three major assemblies:\n \n      1) The Meteorology Sensor Array (MSA), which supports\n      the wind and temperature sensors and provides a\n      housing for the low-level electronics.\n      2) The Meteorology Boom Assembly (MBA), which\n      provides the means for positioning the MSA after\n      landing.  Following deployment of the MBA, the MSA is\n      positioned nominally 1.6 meters above the ground, 0.7\n      meter above the top of the Lander body, and about 0.3\n      meter horizontally outward from the closest portion\n      of the Lander body.\n      3) The Meteorology Electronic Assembly (MEA), which\n      provides power to the sensors and conditions the\n      signals from the sensors so that the proper interface\n      with the Lander electronic system is maintained.\n \n      The individual sensors are described below (see\n      CHAMBERLAIN_ETAL1976):\n \n      The ambient pressure sensor is located in the Lander body near\n      the MEA and has an external pressure line running to a port on\n      the bottom plate of the Lander body.  The sensor is a\n      stretched-diaphragm-type variable reluctance transducer that\n      operates over a range of 0 to 18 millibars.\n \n      The ambient temperature sensor consists of three\n      Chromel-Constantan thermocouples wired in parallel.  It is\n      capable of measuring over the entire range of expected martian\n      temperatures with an accuracy of about 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n \n      The reference temperature sensor was a platinum resistance\n      thermometer mounted between the wind speed elements (see\n      below).\n \n      Wind speed is measured by means of two hot film anemometers\n      oriented orthogonal to each other and lying in the horizontal\n      plane.  These hot film elements were maintained at a nominal\n      overheat temperature of 100 degrees Celsius above the air\n      temperature measured by the reference temperature sensor.  The\n      power required to maintain each anemometer at the specified\n      temperature was a function of the component of the wind speed\n      orthogonal to the element.\n \n      The wind speed sensors also measure wind direction, but with a\n      fourfold ambiguity.  Selection of the proper quadrant is\n      accomplished by a quadrant sensor, consisting of a heated\n      cylindrical platinum core (maintained at a 100 degrees Celsius\n      overheat) surrounded by four thermocouple junctions at equal\n      angles and distance from the core.  Thermocouples on opposite\n      sides of the post comprised a thermocouple pair which was\n      connected in series, allowing for measurement of the\n      temperature differences across each pair.  These differences\n      resulted from the thermal wake in the lee of the heated center\n      core.  The quadrant sensor values were functions, though not\n      single-valued, of wind speed.  The redundant wind speed and\n      directional information provided by both the wind speed and\n      quadrant sensors was combined using a least squares technique\n      to give the best estimates of wind speed and direction.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The scientific objectives of the Viking Meteorology Instrument\n      System (VMIS) are:\n \n      DETECTION OF MEDIUM- AND SMALL-SCALE SYSTEMS: The length scales\n      associated with convective processes (thermals, dust devils)\n      and mesoscale processes (fronts, small dust storms) are\n      considerably greater than the length scales that can be\n      measured by the Lander.  These atmospheric systems can be\n      detected and studied by the VMIS only when they pass the\n      Landers and then only if the VMIS is taking data at the time\n      the system passes.  It is an objective of the VMIS to measure\n      the passage of such systems and to study their structures.\n \n      MEASUREMENT OF SYNOPTIC- AND PLANETARY-SCALE SYSTEMS: With just\n      two observation points, it will not be possible to study the\n      structure of atmospheric systems on a planetary scale.  It will\n      be possible, however, to determine some parameters about the\n      general circulation that can provide useful constraints on\n      theory.  Examples are measurements of large-scale winds,\n      diurnal variations, and annual variations of atmospheric\n      conditions.\n \n      DETERMINATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYER:\n      An objective of the VMIS is to measure temperature, wind speed,\n      and wind direction in the turbulent boundary layer to\n      understand better the vertical transport of properties such as\n      momentum and heat throughout the diurnal cycle.\n \n      MEASUREMENT OF THE LOCAL ENVIORNMENT: It is an objective to\n      determine the meteorological environment in which the Landers\n      operate and how that environment varies diurnally, seasonally,\n      and annually.\n \n      SUPPORT OF OTHER EXPERIMENTS: Measurements made by VMIS may aid\n      in the analysis of data obtained by other Lander experiments.\n      For example, wind gusts can shake the Lander and cause spurious\n      signals to be generated by the seismometer.  Measurements of\n      wind speed and direction may aid in analyzing images of clouds\n      (dust and condensate), and temperature data will aid in\n      interpretation of observations of condensates.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Failure of the quadrant sensor on Lander 1 sol 45 (see\n      HESS_ETAL_1977) precludes unambiguous determination of wind\n      direction without modification to the analysis techniques and\n      software used to generate the wind direction data.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The Viking Meteorology Instrument System (VMIS), including\n      software, was subjected to an extensive test program at the\n      Langley Research Center.  The instrument was tested over the\n      anticipated range of Martian wind speeds (directions 0 to 360\n      degrees) and at temperatures as low as 200 degrees Kelvin.  The\n      data from these tests were reduced using the flight software,\n      and the results were compared to facility parameters that were\n      reduced independently.  These tests indicate that the VMIS\n      (including software, but not accounting for Lander flow-field\n      effects) has an accuracy of about 10% in wind speed, 10% in\n      wind direction, and 1.5 degree Kelvin in temperature.\n \n      The pressure transducers were calibrated to approximately 0.01\n      to 0.02 millibars accuracy over the ranges expected for martian\n      atmospheric pressure variation.  Calibrations to accuracies\n      greater than allowed by the digitizing system were accomplished\n      by test support instrumentation.  Repeatability from year to\n      year of the daily average pressures indicates that the\n      transducers have remained stable to significantly better than\n      0.04 millibars throughout the mission, possibly maintaining\n      stabilities on the order of 0.01 millibars.\n \n      It should be noted that the Meteorology Boom Assembly was\n      positioned on the Lander to minimize the effects of the\n      Lander-induced flow field.  The Lander effect is about 10% in\n      wind direction and 10% in wind speed and is a function of wind\n      direction and possibly local terrain.  Turbulence and other\n      effects will further contribute to instrument error.  However,\n      the overall accuracy is not expected to be substantially\n      different from that determined in the test program.\n \n \n    Section 'MET'\n    =============\n      Total Fovs                     : -32678\n      Data Rate                      : UNK\n      Scan Mode Id                   : UNK\n      Sample Bits                    : UNK\n \n \n      'MET' Detectors\n      ---------------\n        AMBIENT TEMPERATURE\n        PRESSURE\n        REFERENCE TEMP\n        WIND QUADRANT\n        WIND SPEED\n \n \n      'MET' Electronics\n      -----------------\n        MEA\n \n \n      In modes\n      --------\n        NORMAL\n \n \n      'MET' Section Parameter 'PRESSURE'\n      ----------------------------------\n        The force per unit area applied to a body.\n \n        Instrument Parameter Name      : PRESSURE\n        Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME\n        Instrument Parameter Unit      : MILLIBAR\n        Minimum Instrument Parameter   : UNK\n        Maximum Instrument Parameter   : UNK\n        Noise Level                    : UNK\n        Sampling Parameter Unit        : SECOND\n \n \n      'MET' Section Parameter 'TEMPERATURE'\n      -------------------------------------\n        The temperature of a system is a measure of the heat content\n        of the system, and determines if a system is in thermal\n        equilibrium with other systems.\n \n        Instrument Parameter Name      : TEMPERATURE\n        Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME\n        Instrument Parameter Unit      : DEGREES CELSIUS\n        Minimum Instrument Parameter   : UNK\n        Maximum Instrument Parameter   : UNK\n        Noise Level                    : UNK\n        Sampling Parameter Unit        : SECOND\n \n \n      'MET' Section Parameter 'WIND VELOCITY'\n      ---------------------------------------\n        The velocity of a parcel of atmosphere in motion relative to\n        a reference location.\n \n        Instrument Parameter Name      : WIND VELOCITY\n        Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME\n        Instrument Parameter Unit      : METERS/SECOND\n        Minimum Instrument Parameter   : UNK\n        Maximum Instrument Parameter   : UNK\n        Noise Level                    : UNK\n        Sampling Parameter Unit        : SECOND\n \n \n    Instrument Detector 'AMBIENT TEMPERATURE'\n    =========================================\n      Detector Type                  : THERMOCOUPLE\n      Nominal Operating Temperature  : UNK\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The ambient temperature sensor consists of three\n        Chromel-Constantan thermocouples wired in parallel.

These hot film elements were maintained at a nominal\n        overheat temperature of 100 degrees Celsius above the air\n        temperature measured by the reference temperature sensor.\n        The power required to maintain each anemometer at the\n        specified temperature was a function of the component of the\n        wind speed orthogonal to the element.  The wind speed sensors\n        also measure wind direction, but with a fourfold ambiguity.\n        This ambiguity was resolved using a quadrant sensor (see\n        detector description for the WIND QUADRANT sensor).\n \n \n      Sensitivity\n      -----------\n        UNK\n \n \n    Instrument Electronics 'MEA'\n    ============================\n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The Meteorology Electronic Assembly (MEA) which provides\n        power to the meteorology sensors and conditions the signals\n        from the sensors so that the proper interface with the Lander\n        electronic system is maintained.  It also provides the\n        digital electronics necessary for data storage.  The key\n        sections of the MEA are:\n \n        1) COMMAND PROCESSOR receives, stores, and executes 24-bit\n        serial commands generated by the Lander Guidance Control and\n        Sequencing Computer (GCSC).\n \n        2) DATA SEQUENCER AND MASTER CLOCK receives the 288 kHz\n        Lander clock signal from the GCSC and generates the necessary\n        internal clock frequencies for data commutation, sequencing,\n        and buffer storage.\n \n        3) WIND SPEED CONTROL ELECTRONICS maintains the hot-film wind\n        sensors and the quadrant heater at 100 degrees Celsius above\n        the measured reference temperature.  Measurements are made of\n        the sensor pulse width, pulse height, and resistance to\n        permit the computation of sensor power dissipation and\n        temperature.\n \n        4) TEMPERATURE SENSOR ELECTRONICS for the ambient temperature\n        thermocouple, the reference junction film, and the quadrant\n        sensor thermocouples all employ chopper-stabilized amplifiers\n        to minimize drift.  The output of the amplifiers is fed to an\n        integrating analog-to-digital converter (ADC).\n \n        5) ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTER (ADC) is a 10-bit, dual-slope\n        converter that samples the signals as directed by the data\n        sequencer.  The ADC has a range of 0 to 5 volt input with a\n        resolution of 0.05% of full scale.\n \n        6) MEMORY acts as a data buffer between the MEA and the Data\n        Acquisition and Processor Unit (DAPU).  It has a storage\n        capacity of 290 16-bit data words.\n \n        7) AMBIENT PRESSURE SENSOR used for the parachute entry\n        portion of the mission is also used by the VMIS.  The sensor\n        is a stretched-diaphragm-type variable reluctance transducer.\n        The sensor is located near the MEA and has an external\n        pressure line running to a port on the bottom plate of the\n        Lander body.\n \n \n    Instrument Mode 'NORMAL'\n    ========================\n      Data Path Type                 : REALTIME\n      Gain Mode Id                   : UNK\n      Instrument Power Consumption   : UNK\n \n \n      In sections\n      -----------\n        MET\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The onboard Lander software was designed to provide a high\n        degree of flexibility in the manner in which meteorology data\n        are taken.  Under ground command, the sampling rate, duration\n        over which a given sampling rate is maintained, the serial\n        sequence of sampling rates and duration, the time between\n        sampling sequences, the times and frequencies of sampling\n        initiation, and the total amount of data taken per martian\n        day (sol) can be varied.  Prior to landing, preplanned\n        sequences were loaded into each Lander.  These consisted of\n        modules with durations of of about 9, 20, and 39 minutes\n        spaced nominally 1.5 hours apart throughout the sol.\n        Intervals between individual samples were 4 and 8 seconds for\n        the 9 minute modules, 4 seconds for the 39 minute modules,\n        and 2 seconds for the 20 minute modules.  One complete\n        sequence consisted of 18 modules.  Sixteen of these were 9\n        minutes long and two, spaced about 12 hours apart, were of\n        longer duration (one being 39 minutes long, the other 20\n        minutes long).  The 18 periods were spaced so as to occupy\n        somewhat more than a sol.  As a result, the pattern of\n        sequences stepped ahead about 1.5 hours each sol.  This\n        survey mode was adopted in order to define the diurnal cycle\n        while moving long sequences through the sol, thus permitting\n        a study of fluctuation characteristics at all portions of the\n        diurnal cycle.\n \n        Later in the mission, extended periods of rapid sampling\n        (about 1 second intervals) were included to study boundary\n        layer characteristics at as high a sampling rate as the\n        system would allow.  In addition, various alterations were\n        made in sampling rates, durations, and measurement periods to\n        determine an optimal pattern for sampling the martian\n        atmosphere.  It became evident that the total science return\n        would be maximized by taking samples nearly continuously but\n        at rates slow enough to satisfy mission constraints on total\n        meteorology data.  This approach was followed during much of\n        the remainder of the mission, except when precluded by\n        mission requirements.\n \n \n    Mounted On Platform 'METEOROLOGY BOOM ASSEMBLY'\n    ===============================================\n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The Meteorology Boom Assembly (MBA) consists of a deployable\n        boom which supports the Meteorology Sensor Array (MSA) in a\n        stowed position during the launch, cruise, and entry portions\n        of the mission.  A short time after landing, a\n        pyrotechnic-activated pin releases the boom, which deploys\n        and latches in an extended position.  Following deployment of\n        the MBA, the MSA is positioned nominally 1.6 meters above the\n        ground, 0.7 meter above the top of the Lander body, and about\n        0.3 meter horizontally outward from the closest portion of\n        the Lander body.  The Meteorology Sensor Array (MSA) supports\n        the wind and temperature sensors and provides a housing for\n        the low-level electronics, while the ambient pressure sensor\n        is mounted within the Lander body (near the Meteorology\n        Electronic Assembly).",

The lander camera was a\n      facsimile camera with a single, stationary photosensor array\n      (PSA) and azimuth and elevation scanning mechanisms.  A lander\n      image was generated by scanning the scene in two directions\n      (azimuth and elevation) to focus light onto the photosensor\n      array.  A number of published papers described the\n      characteristics and performance of the lander cameras.  The\n      scientific rational and early design of the cameras were\n      described in Mutch et al.  [1972] and a detailed description of\n      the flight cameras was given in Huck et al. [1975b].  Huck and\n      Wall [1976] discussed image quality and Patterson et al.\n      [1977] described camera performance during the Primary Mission.\n      A summary of the information from these papers is given here as\n      a high-level description of the camera and its operating modes.\n \n \n    Platform Mounting Descriptions\n    ==============================\n      Each camera was bolted to the top of the lander body.  The\n      camera had a lower stationary section containing electronics\n      and an upper section that rotated in azimuth (i.e., around a\n      vertical axis).  The other prominent exterior component was a\n      post assembly that protected the camera window from the Mars\n      environment when the camera was not in use.  At the top of the\n      post was a carbon dioxide dust removal nozzle.  Major internal\n      camera components were two fused silica windows, a mirror,\n      elevation and azimuth rotation assemblies, a lens, the\n      photosensor array, electronics, and pinlights for calibration.\n      The overall camera height was 55.6 cm.  The lower assembly\n      diameter was 25.6 cm and the upper assembly diameter was 14.4\n      cm.  The weight of the camera was 7.26 kg.  Below is a table\n      that lists the serial number of the cameras and photosensor\n      arrays as they were assigned to the flight cameras [Huck et\n      al., 1975a].\n \n      Camera                  Serial Number  PSA Serial Number\n      --------------------------------------------------------\n      Viking 1, camera 1      FC-1B               M017\n \n      Viking 1, camera 2      FC-2A               M020\n \n      Viking 2, camera 1      FC-3A               M015\n \n      Viking 2, camera 2      SPARE               M019\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      The camera had several features to deal with possible dust\n      abrasion or obscuration.  When the camera was not in use, the\n      upper assembly was rotated so that the window was behind the\n      post assembly to prevent exposure to dust.  Mounted in the post\n      was a nozzle for releasing carbon dioxide gas to blow dust off\n      the window.  In addition, the outer window, known as the\n      contamination cover, was designed to move out of the optical\n      path if it became abraded or dust coated.  The contamination\n      cover window was hinged and spring loaded so that it could be\n      deployed by rotating the camera behind the post with enough\n      force to release the spring lever.  During the Extended Mission\n      the contamination cover windows of camera 1 on lander 1 and\n      camera 2 on lander 2 were deployed.  One drawback of the\n      contamination cover window was that its frame caused a\n      vignetting effect at elevation angles above 25 deg.  [Patterson\n      et al., 1977].\n \n      Light entered the camera through the windows, reflected off the\n      mirror toward the lens, passed through the lens, and was sensed\n      by one of the photodiodes.  A voltage was generated in the\n      selected photodiode that was digitized by an analog-to-digital\n      (A/D) converter.  Below the lens was a black shutter that could\n      be closed to sample photodiode dark current and to perform\n      internal radiometric calibration.  Between the lens and\n      photosensor array was a light baffle to minimize internal\n      reflections.  The lens had a 0.95 cm aperture diameter and 5.37\n      cm focal length.\n \n      Mechanical scanning was done by rotating the mirror around a\n      horizontal axis to scan each vertical line in an image.  The\n      entire upper camera assembly rotated around a vertical axis to\n      scan successive lines.  Image data were collected while the\n      mirror rotated up through the elevation range in 512 steps\n      (i.e., pixels were sampled from the bottom of the image to the\n      top).  The mirror rapidly rotated down to the start position\n      while the camera turned in azimuth for the next scan.  The\n      mirror could rotate from 60 deg below the horizon to 40 deg\n      above it for a total range of 100 deg.  The camera could see\n      342.5 deg in azimuth with the range limited by the post\n      assembly.  Image commands specified both a start and stop\n      azimuth such that the width of images varied.  On receiving a\n      command to acquire an image, the camera first rotated to a\n      preset azimuth and then rotated to the start azimuth.  The\n      camera stepped in azimuth after each vertical scan until the\n      stop azimuth was reached.  The sequence ended by the camera\n      moving back to the preset position and then to the park\n      position with the window behind the post.  The preset position\n      at the beginning and end of the sequence prevented the camera\n      from turning through mechanical stops.  Internal radiometric\n      calibration could be done by closing the shutter while the\n      camera was in the preset position either before or after the\n      image data were acquired.  The camera had two scanning rates so\n      that data could be collected at 250 or 16,000 bits/sec.\n \n      The photosensor array consisted of 12 silicon photodiodes (or\n      diodes) sensitive to light between 0.4 and 1.1 micrometers.\n      The diodes were arranged in a 2x6 array.  There were four broad\n      band, high resolution (0.04 deg angular resolution) diodes,\n      known as BB1, BB2, BB3, and BB4.  The distance between the lens\n      and each high resolution diode was different to vary the\n      in-focus distance of each diode.  In-focus distances were 1.9,\n      3.7, 4.5, and 13.3 meters for BB1, BB2, BB3, an BB4,\n      respectively.  There was a low resolution (0.12 deg angular\n      resolution), broad band diode known as the SURVEY diode.  There\n      were also six narrow band, low resolution diodes for color\n      (BLUE, GREEN, and RED) and infrared (IR1, IR2, and IR3) images.\n      The narrow bandwidth was generated by covering diodes with a\n      set of interference filters, chosen to survive the spacecraft\n      sterilization process.  The interference filters had\n      significant out-of-band leaks.  Also, the infrared filters were\n      known to degrade due to neutron radiation from the lander RTGs\n      [Patterson et al., 1977].  The twelfth diode was also a low\n      resolution diode covered by a red filter for imaging the Sun.\n      The in-focus distance for the low resolution diodes was about\n      3.7 meters.\n \n      Diodes in the camera generated a voltage proportional to\n      incoming radiance.  Each diode, except for the SUN diode, had\n      an amplifier to enhance the voltage signal.  The SUN diode did\n      not need an amplifier because of the strong signal when\n      directly viewing the Sun.  Voltage from the amplifier was\n      digitized as a 6-bit number in an A/D converter that also\n      performed automatic dark current subtraction.  Dark current was\n      sampled after every line in slow scan mode and after every 64th\n      line in rapid scan mode.  The A/D converter had 6 gains and 32\n      offsets so that the full dynamic range of the diode output\n      could be stored in 6-bits.  Gain defined the voltage range\n      sampled and its resolution.  Low gain (high gain number)\n      covered a wide range in voltage and had low voltage resolution.\n      The offset could be varied from a slightly negative voltage to\n      several volts in 32 small steps.  Digital values from the A/D\n      converter could be dumped to the spacecraft tape recorder or\n      transmitted to Earth or an orbiter in real-time (usually done\n      at beginning or end of a transmission link when the bit error\n      rate was relatively high).\n \n      Each camera had two pinlights in the post assembly.  Using a\n      special command, the lights turned on and an image was acquired\n      while viewing the pinlights.  This command, known as a scan\n      verification, monitored the mechanical scanning operation of\n      the camera.  A third pinlight with four different radiance\n      levels was located between the dark current shutter and the\n      photosensor array.  This pinlight was used with the shutter\n      closed for radiometric calibration of the camera.\n \n \n    Operation and Sampling Modes\n    ============================\n      Operation of Viking Lander cameras was versatile in that many\n      parameters for the image could be specified.  Commands to\n      acquire an image involved selecting the sampling mode, diode,\n      start and stop azimuths, center elevation, gain and offset,\n      scan rate, and specifying whether automatic dark current\n      subtraction, internal calibration, rescan, or dusting were\n      done.  Image start time and whether the image was transmitted\n      in real-time or sent to the tape recorder were also specified.\n \n      The camera had seven sampling modes: low resolution (0.12 deg)\n      stepping with three diodes (known as triplet mode); low\n      resolution stepping with one diode; high resolution (0.04 deg)\n      stepping with one diode; and four different calibration lamp\n      intensity levels.  In triplet mode, elevation scanning was\n      repeated three times with three different diodes at every\n      azimuth position.  An unusual sampling mode effect was an\n      elevation shift when the step size did not match the diode\n      resolution.  There was a -5.6 deg elevation shift when using a\n      low resolution diode with high resolution stepping and a +5.6\n      deg shift when using a high resolution diode with low\n      resolution stepping.  These non-nominal modes were mostly used\n      to generate high resolution color images or to better resolve\n      the solar disk.  For the triplet mode, the specified diode was\n      the first of the three diodes, e.g., BLUE diode for a color\n      image.  Start and stop azimuths had to be multiples of 2.5 deg.\n      Center elevation had to be a multiple of 10 deg.  The elevation\n      range was determined by the step size with a range of about 20\n      deg for high resolution and about 60 deg for low resolution\n      since there was always 512 steps in an elevation scan.  Rescan\n      was done by inhibiting the azimuth rotation and repeatedly\n      scanning in elevation.  Rescan could be activated by commanding\n      the camera to operate for a time longer then it took to scan\n      the azimuth range of the image.\n \n \n    Principal Investigator\n    ======================\n      The principal investigator for the Viking Lander imaging system\n      during instrument development and the Viking Primary Mission\n      was Thomas A.  Mutch of Brown University.  From the Extended\n      Mission until the end of the Viking Mission, Raymond E.\n      Arvidson of Washington University was the lander imaging\n      principal investigator.",

On receiving a\n      command to acquire an image, the camera first rotated to a\n      preset azimuth and then rotated to the start azimuth.  The\n      camera stepped in azimuth after each vertical scan until the\n      stop azimuth was reached.  The sequence ended by the camera\n      moving back to the preset position and then to the park\n      position with the window behind the post.  The preset position\n      at the beginning and end of the sequence prevented the camera\n      from turning through mechanical stops.  Internal radiometric\n      calibration could be done by closing the shutter while the\n      camera was in the preset position either before or after the\n      image data were acquired.  The camera had two scanning rates so\n      that data could be collected at 250 or 16,000 bits/sec.\n \n      The photosensor array consisted of 12 silicon photodiodes (or\n      diodes) sensitive to light between 0.4 and 1.1 micrometers.\n      The diodes were arranged in a 2x6 array.  There were four broad\n      band, high resolution (0.04 deg angular resolution) diodes,\n      known as BB1, BB2, BB3, and BB4.  The distance between the lens\n      and each high resolution diode was different to vary the\n      in-focus distance of each diode.  In-focus distances were 1.9,\n      3.7, 4.5, and 13.3 meters for BB1, BB2, BB3, an BB4,\n      respectively.  There was a low resolution (0.12 deg angular\n      resolution), broad band diode known as the SURVEY diode.  There\n      were also six narrow band, low resolution diodes for color\n      (BLUE, GREEN, and RED) and infrared (IR1, IR2, and IR3) images.\n      The narrow bandwidth was generated by covering diodes with a\n      set of interference filters, chosen to survive the spacecraft\n      sterilization process.  The interference filters had\n      significant out-of-band leaks.  Also, the infrared filters were\n      known to degrade due to neutron radiation from the lander RTGs\n      [Patterson et al., 1977].  The twelfth diode was also a low\n      resolution diode covered by a red filter for imaging the Sun.\n      The in-focus distance for the low resolution diodes was about\n      3.7 meters.\n \n      Diodes in the camera generated a voltage proportional to\n      incoming radiance.  Each diode, except for the SUN diode, had\n      an amplifier to enhance the voltage signal.  The SUN diode did\n      not need an amplifier because of the strong signal when\n      directly viewing the Sun.  Voltage from the amplifier was\n      digitized as a 6-bit number in an A/D converter that also\n      performed automatic dark current subtraction.  Dark current was\n      sampled after every line in slow scan mode and after every 64th\n      line in rapid scan mode.  The A/D converter had 6 gains and 32\n      offsets so that the full dynamic range of the diode output\n      could be stored in 6-bits.  Gain defined the voltage range\n      sampled and its resolution.  Low gain (high gain number)\n      covered a wide range in voltage and had low voltage resolution.\n      The offset could be varied from a slightly negative voltage to\n      several volts in 32 small steps.  Digital values from the A/D\n      converter could be dumped to the spacecraft tape recorder or\n      transmitted to Earth or an orbiter in real-time (usually done\n      at beginning or end of a transmission link when the bit error\n      rate was relatively high).\n \n      Each camera had two pinlights in the post assembly.  Using a\n      special command, the lights turned on and an image was acquired\n      while viewing the pinlights.  This command, known as a scan\n      verification, monitored the mechanical scanning operation of\n      the camera.  A third pinlight with four different radiance\n      levels was located between the dark current shutter and the\n      photosensor array.  This pinlight was used with the shutter\n      closed for radiometric calibration of the camera.\n \n \n    Operation and Sampling Modes\n    ============================\n      Operation of Viking Lander cameras was versatile in that many\n      parameters for the image could be specified.  Commands to\n      acquire an image involved selecting the sampling mode, diode,\n      start and stop azimuths, center elevation, gain and offset,\n      scan rate, and specifying whether automatic dark current\n      subtraction, internal calibration, rescan, or dusting were\n      done.  Image start time and whether the image was transmitted\n      in real-time or sent to the tape recorder were also specified.\n \n      The camera had seven sampling modes: low resolution (0.12 deg)\n      stepping with three diodes (known as triplet mode); low\n      resolution stepping with one diode; high resolution (0.04 deg)\n      stepping with one diode; and four different calibration lamp\n      intensity levels.  In triplet mode, elevation scanning was\n      repeated three times with three different diodes at every\n      azimuth position.  An unusual sampling mode effect was an\n      elevation shift when the step size did not match the diode\n      resolution.  There was a -5.6 deg elevation shift when using a\n      low resolution diode with high resolution stepping and a +5.6\n      deg shift when using a high resolution diode with low\n      resolution stepping.  These non-nominal modes were mostly used\n      to generate high resolution color images or to better resolve\n      the solar disk.  For the triplet mode, the specified diode was\n      the first of the three diodes, e.g., BLUE diode for a color\n      image.  Start and stop azimuths had to be multiples of 2.5 deg.\n      Center elevation had to be a multiple of 10 deg.  The elevation\n      range was determined by the step size with a range of about 20\n      deg for high resolution and about 60 deg for low resolution\n      since there was always 512 steps in an elevation scan.  Rescan\n      was done by inhibiting the azimuth rotation and repeatedly\n      scanning in elevation.  Rescan could be activated by commanding\n      the camera to operate for a time longer then it took to scan\n      the azimuth range of the image.\n \n \n    Principal Investigator\n    ======================\n      The principal investigator for the Viking Lander imaging system\n      during instrument development and the Viking Primary Mission\n      was Thomas A.  Mutch of Brown University.  From the Extended\n      Mission until the end of the Viking Mission, Raymond E.\n      Arvidson of Washington University was the lander imaging\n      principal investigator.",

The MAWD instrument is a fixed grating\n      spectrometer having five channels centered on three absorption\n      lines and two continuum regions between these lines.  All\n      channels utilize PbS detectors; the spectral resolution of each\n      is about 1.2 cm**-1.  The instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of\n      the detectors is 0.96 by 0.12 degree.  The IFOV can be\n      step-scanned perpendicular to its long dimension through\n      fifteen positions by a raster mirror incorporated in the\n      optical train.  The time spent at each step (approximately the\n      signal integration time) is 280 milliseconds, and the duration\n      of the raster is 4.48 seconds.  The combination of the motions\n      of the raster mirror, the orbiter scan platform, and the\n      orbital ground track generates sets of slew patterns over the\n      planet's surface.  A basic description of the instrument, its\n      observational modes and its derived data products is given in\n      FARMER_ETAL_1977.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      There are two major objectives of the Viking MAWD experiments.\n      The first of these is to map, during the far encounter and\n      preliminary orbital phases, the distribution of water vapor\n      over the planet, and in this way perform the vital initial\n      function of investigating prospective lading sites with respect\n      to this particular characteristic.  The second objective is\n      concerned with the nature of the water vapor cycle itself and\n      the relationship between the martian atmospheric and surface or\n      subsurface water.  To this end, the observations are designed\n      to investigate spatial, diurnal, and seasonal variations of\n      water vapor with high spatial and temporal resolutions.  A\n      basic description of the instrument, its observational modes\n      and its derived data products is given in FARMER_ETAL_1977.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      The MAWD instrument on Viking Orbiter 1 operated normally\n      throughout the mission.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The precise frequency location of the various channels is\n      maintained against possible shifts due to thermal distortion of\n      the instrument's optical alignment by a monochromatic neon\n      reference system, using a set of silicon photodiodes as\n      detectors.  Motion of the neon lamp exit plane image with\n      respect to the silicon reference detectors is sensed and used\n      to drive a cam which repositions the grating to preserve the\n      correct wavelength alignment.  The channel responses are\n      corrected by means of periodic calibrations made by inserting a\n      mirror into the input beam so that the detectors view a\n      sunlight-illuminated diffusely reflecting plate mounted on a\n      structural member of the spacecraft.\n \n \n    Section 'MAWD'\n    ==============\n      Total Fovs                     : 15\n      Data Rate

The camera system is commonly called the Visual\n      Imaging Subsystem (VIS).  Each camera consists of a telescope,\n      a slow scan vidicon, a filter wheel, and associated\n      electronics.  The filter wheel contains blue, minus blue,\n      violet, clear, green, and red filters.  The angular field of\n      view as defined by the reseau pattern is 1.51 by 1.69 degrees.\n      Since the scan lines go beyond the reseau pattern in the line\n      direction the active field of view is about 1.54 degrees in\n      this direction.  The actual ground area covered by an image\n      varies as a function of spacecraft altitude and emission angle.\n      The digital image is generated by scanning the vidicon face\n      plate.  The signal is digitized as a 7-bit number.  The image\n      contains 1056 horizontal lines.  There are 1182 samples in each\n      line exposed to incoming light.  The vidicon samples 11 pixels\n      on either side of the raster onto an opaque mask located at the\n      front of each vidicon.  Hence, 1204 samples per line are\n      telemetered to Earth, but only 1182 contain information.  Each\n      camera can be commanded to acquire an image every 8.96 seconds.\n      By alternating cameras, an image can be taken every 4.48\n      seconds.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The first objective of the imaging system was to characterize\n      potential landing sites in support of site selection.\n      Additional objectives of the imaging system were to study the\n      photometric and colorimetric properties of the surface\n      discovered by Mariner 9 in order to better understand the\n      geological history of Mars atmosphere.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Each Viking Orbiter camera contained a filter wheel with five\n      filters and a clear position, i.e., no filter.  An image could\n      be acquired using one of the six filters types, which included\n      blue, minus blue, violet, clear, green, and red.  The filter\n      wheel could be stepped only one position between each exposure.\n      Three mode parameters or camera states could be set for a given\n      exposure.  There was the light flood condition flag.  Light\n      flooding was used to reduce the residual image from the\n      previous exposure.  Eight small incandescent bulbs exposed the\n      vidicon beyond saturation.  There were also two gain states:\n      low and high.  The high gain state increased the gain by a\n      factor of 2.  There was also an exposure offset that would\n      provide a positive signal (DN) from the camera even for a zero\n      exposure.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal\n      received from the camera (DN value) into a quantity that is\n      proportional to the radiance reaching the sensor.  The\n      sensitivity of the vidicon varies across the field of view.\n      The sensitivity of the vidicon also varies with time.  Each\n      Viking Orbiter imaging instrument was calibrated before flight.\n      In addition, changes in the calibration over time have been\n      estimated from analyses of images of deep space and dust\n      storms.  The radiometric calibration applies additive and\n      multiplicative corrections that account for the varying\n      sensitivity of the vidicon.  The resulting values are\n      proportional to radiance factor, which is defined as the ratio\n      of the observed radiance to the radiance of a normally\n      illuminated lambertian reflector of unit reflectance at the\n      same heliocentric distance.  The geometric calibration removes\n      electronic distortions and transforms the point perspective\n      geometry of the original image into a map projection.  The\n      electronic distortions are barrel- shaped distortions from the\n      electron beam readout and complex distortions from interactions\n      between the charge on the vidicon face plate and the electron\n      beam.  The electronic distortions are modeled by comparing the\n      undistorted locations of reseau marks with the actual locations\n      in an image.\n \n \n    Section 'VISA'\n    ==============\n      Total Fovs                     : 1\n      Data Rate                      : 2112000.000000\n      Sample Bits                    : 7\n \n \n      'VISA' Detectors\n      ----------------\n        VISA\n \n \n      'VISA' Electronics\n      ------------------\n        VISA\n \n \n      'VISA' Filters\n      --------------\n        BLUE\n        CLEAR\n        GREEN\n        MINUS BLUE\n        RED\n        VIOLET\n \n \n      'VISA' Section Optic IDs\n      ------------------------\n        VISA\n \n \n      In modes\n      --------\n        ...\n        ..D\n        .G.\n        .GD\n        L..\n        L.D\n        LG.\n        LGD\n \n \n      'VISA' Section FOV Shape 'RECTANGULAR'\n      --------------------------------------\n        Section Id                     : VISA\n        Fovs                           : 1\n        Horizontal Pixel Fov           : 0.001420\n        Vertical Pixel Fov             : 0.001420\n        Horizontal Fov                 : 1.693000\n        Vertical Fov                   : 1.540000\n \n \n      'VISA' Section Parameter 'RADIANCE'\n      -----------------------------------\n        Radiance is the amount of energy per time per projected area\n        per steradian.\n \n        Instrument Parameter Name      : RADIANCE\n        Sampling Parameter Name        : PIXEL\n        Instrument Parameter Unit      : WATT/(METER*METER)/STERADIAN\n        Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 0.001420\n        Sampling Parameter Unit        : DEGREE\n \n \n    Instrument Detector 'VISA'\n    ==========================\n      Detector Type                  : VIDICON\n      Detector Aspect Ratio          : 1.120000\n      Minimum Wavelength             : 0.350000\n      Maximum Wavelength             : 0.650000\n      Nominal Operating Temperature  : 288.000000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The VIS detector is a Westinghouse 5166 selenium vidicon.

The camera system is commonly called the Visual\n      Imaging Subsystem (VIS).  Each camera consists of a telescope,\n      a slow scan vidicon, a filter wheel, and associated\n      electronics.  The filter wheel contains blue, minus blue,\n      violet, clear, green, and red filters.  The angular field of\n      view as defined by the reseau pattern is 1.51 by 1.69 degrees.\n      Since the scan lines go beyond the reseau pattern in the line\n      direction the active field of view is about 1.54 degrees in\n      this direction.  The actual ground area covered by an image\n      varies as a function of spacecraft altitude and emission angle.\n      The digital image is generated by scanning the vidicon face\n      plate.  The signal is digitized as a 7-bit number.  The image\n      contains 1056 horizontal lines.  There are 1182 samples in each\n      line exposed to incoming light.  The vidicon samples 11 pixels\n      on either side of the raster onto an opaque mask located at the\n      front of each vidicon.  Hence, 1204 samples per line are\n      telemetered to Earth, but only 1182 contain information.  Each\n      camera can be commanded to acquire an image every 8.96 seconds.\n      By alternating cameras, an image can be taken every 4.48\n      seconds.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The first objective of the imaging system was to characterize\n      potential landing sites in support of site selection.\n      Additional objectives of the imaging system were to study the\n      photometric and colorimetric properties of the surface\n      discovered by Mariner 9 in order to better understand the\n      geological history of Mars atmosphere.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Each Viking Orbiter camera contained a filter wheel with five\n      filters and a clear position, i.e., no filter.  An image could\n      be acquired using one of the six filters types, which included\n      blue, minus blue, violet, clear, green, and red.  The filter\n      wheel could be stepped only one position between each exposure.\n      Three mode parameters or camera states could be set for a given\n      exposure.  There was the light flood condition flag.  Light\n      flooding was used to reduce the residual image from the\n      previous exposure.  Eight small incandescent bulbs exposed the\n      vidicon beyond saturation.  There were also two gain states:\n      low and high.  The high gain state increased the gain by a\n      factor of 2.  There was also an exposure offset that would\n      provide a positive signal (DN) from the camera even for a zero\n      exposure.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal\n      received from the camera (DN value) into a quantity that is\n      proportional to the radiance reaching the sensor.  The\n      sensitivity of the vidicon varies across the field of view.\n      The sensitivity of the vidicon also varies with time.  Each\n      Viking Orbiter imaging instrument was calibrated before flight.\n      In addition, changes in the calibration over time have been\n      estimated from analyses of images of deep space and dust\n      storms.  The radiometric calibration applies additive and\n      multiplicative corrections that account for the varying\n      sensitivity of the vidicon.  The resulting values are\n      proportional to radiance factor, which is defined as the ratio\n      of the observed radiance to the radiance of a normally\n      illuminated lambertian reflector of unit reflectance at the\n      same heliocentric distance.  The geometric calibration removes\n      electronic distortions and transforms the point perspective\n      geometry of the original image into a map projection.  The\n      electronic distortions are barrel- shaped distortions from the\n      electron beam readout and complex distortions from interactions\n      between the charge on the vidicon face plate and the electron\n      beam.  The electronic distortions are modeled by comparing the\n      undistorted locations of reseau marks with the actual locations\n      in an image.\n \n \n    Section 'VISB'\n    ==============\n      Total Fovs                     : 1\n      Data Rate                      : 2112000.000000\n      Sample Bits                    : 7\n \n \n      'VISB' Detectors\n      ----------------\n        VISB\n \n \n      'VISB' Electronics\n      ------------------\n        VISB\n \n \n      'VISB' Filters\n      --------------\n        BLUE\n        CLEAR\n        GREEN\n        MINUS BLUE\n        RED\n        VIOLET\n \n \n      'VISB' Section Optic IDs\n      ------------------------\n        VISB\n \n \n      In modes\n      --------\n        ...\n        ..D\n        .G.\n        .GD\n        L..\n        L.D\n        LG.\n        LGD\n \n \n      'VISB' Section FOV Shape 'RECTANGULAR'\n      --------------------------------------\n        Section Id                     : VISB\n        Fovs                           : 1\n        Horizontal Pixel Fov           : 0.001420\n        Vertical Pixel Fov             : 0.001420\n        Horizontal Fov                 : 1.692000\n        Vertical Fov                   : 1.533000\n \n \n      'VISB' Section Parameter 'RADIANCE'\n      -----------------------------------\n        Radiance is the amount of energy per time per projected area\n        per steradian.\n \n        Instrument Parameter Name      : RADIANCE\n        Sampling Parameter Name        : PIXEL\n        Instrument Parameter Unit      : WATT/(METER*METER)/STERADIAN\n        Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 0.001420\n        Sampling Parameter Unit        : DEGREE\n \n \n    Instrument Detector 'VISB'\n    ==========================\n      Detector Type                  : VIDICON\n      Detector Aspect Ratio          : 1.120000\n      Minimum Wavelength             : 0.350000\n      Maximum Wavelength             : 0.650000\n      Nominal Operating Temperature  : 288.000000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The VIS detector is a Westinghouse 5166 selenium vidicon.

There is a total of\n      twenty-eight channels in four surface and one atmospheric\n      thermal band from 6 micrometer to 30 micrometer and a broad\n      solar reflectance band.  All channels are sampled\n      simultaneously, using the spacecraft scanning capability to map\n      the radiance over small and large areas of the planet.  All\n      channels use thermopile detectors; spectral passbands are\n      determined by a combination of interference filters, detector\n      lens materials, antireflection coatings, and reststrahlen\n      optics.  The scan modes are described in the PDS INSTRUMENT\n      MODE DESCRIPTION.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The objective of the Viking Orbiter infrared thermal mapper\n      (IRTM) is to measure the thermal emission of the Martian\n      surface and atmosphere and total reflected sunlight with high\n      spatial and flux resolution.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Most low and moderate resolution IRTM data were acquired\n      through using 'box scans'.  These were commonly acquired\n      between 1-6 hours from periapsis, and utilized the scan\n      platform to slew back and forth in cone angle (in the direction\n      the IRTM chevron points) with small offsets in the same\n      direction between these oscillating slews.  Ignoring spacecraft\n      motion, this pattern would generate bi-directional evenly\n      spaced scans with the seven IRTM detectors.  Spacecraft motion\n      during the scan sequence, typically of 10-40 minutes duration,\n      created some distortion in this otherwise uniform pattern.\n      Typical resulting scans across the planetary surface are shown\n      in Figure 3 of Kieffer et al., 1976.  These scans were usually\n      designed to extend slightly off the limb of the planet on at\n      least one side.  These 'planet port' off-planet data provided\n      the best estimates of the zero radiance response of the\n      instrument.  When the spacecraft was near periapsis, the\n      apparent motion of the planetary surface relative to the\n      spacecraft was too rapid to allow oscillating slews.  At these\n      times, the instrument would simply 'stare' in one direction and\n      use the spacecraft motion to sweep the detector pattern across\n      the surface.  These observations were usually acquired in\n      Normal Mode, but occasionally Fixed Planet was used.  At\n      irregular times through the mission, 'phase function'\n      observations were made.  These involved using the two axis scan\n      platform to follow one point on the ground as the spacecraft\n      went from horizon to horizon relative to this surface point.\n      In actuality, this sequence was acquired using a small number\n      of discrete scan platform moves, allowing the instrument to\n      'stare' across a short stripe centered on the target point\n      between slews.  Such 'phase function' observations typically\n      yielded about 10 different viewing geometries within a single\n      sequence.  These observations were particularly useful in\n      determining the influence of the atmosphere.  In preparation of\n      the IRTM data set, all observations which were more than 1 1/2\n      degrees apparent angle above the nearest limb of the planet\n      were deleted.\n \n      Geometry Errors Due to Uncertain Timing: Early and late during\n      the Viking mission, orbital solutions based on the tracking\n      telemetry were determined every few days.  During VO-1\n      revolution 175-603 and VO-2 revolutions 118-521, orbital\n      solutions were often separated by a week or more.  Because\n      there is significant irregularity in the Martian gravitional\n      field, these irregularities could slowly influence the orbit of\n      the Viking spacecraft in unpredictable ways.  The primary\n      influence was in the period of the orbit, resulting in\n      uncertainty as to exactly where the spacecraft was along its\n      orbit at any specific time.  These uncertainties were as large\n      as 75 seconds in the worst case.  Far from periapsis, these\n      timing uncertainties were not of major significance because the\n      spacecraft velocities were low and the projected fields of\n      views on the planet were large.  However, near periapsis, the\n      IRTM field of view could move across the surface equivalent to\n      its full width in as little as one second.  Thus, when there\n      was a large timing error, the computed ground intercept\n      locations could be in error by many fields of view.  In the\n      worst case, these positions may be in error by up to 200 km.\n      When the magnitude of this problem was discovered, the SEDR\n      (geometry calculations) for the imaging instrument was rerun\n      with revised orbit solutions.  However, it was impractical to\n      regenerate the IRTM SEDR and these errors have not been\n      corrected.  There was an attempt by the navigational team to\n      estimate the magnitude of the timing error for both Viking\n      spacecraft for those revolutions through the affected part of\n      the Viking mission.  This is described in the 1980 April 14\n      memo by Frank Palluconi, which contains estimates of the\n      magnitude of the error for each revolution.  Hugh Kieffer has a\n      copy (the sole surviving copy?) of this memo.  A direct\n      determination of the timing offset can be made from the IRTM\n      data alone in those instances when thermal patterns can be\n      unambiguously identified with surface features.  Since the\n      dominant geometric error is in time, maps of thermal patterns\n      (typically as contours of observed temperature minus the\n      calculated standard model temperature) can be slid across the\n      cartographic map parallel to the subspacecraft track (if the\n      instrument was in fixed planet mode, this is simply sliding the\n      IRTM trace along its own path) until the thermal and\n      cartographic features are aligned.  Because there are small\n      gaps in the IRTM coverage every 64 ICKs, the amount the IRTM\n      pattern must be shifted to agree with the surface morphology\n      can be scaled directly into a timing offset in seconds.  This\n      has been done for a variety of high resolution scans across\n      Arsia Mons (by Jim Zimbelman) and for many scans across Valles\n      Marineris (by David Paige and Hugh Kieffer).  A set of known\n      offsets is slowly accumulating.  Hugh Kieffer has a copy (the\n      sole surviving copy?) of the memo discussing this problem.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      Relative spectral response of all channels was measured end to\n      end using a Perkin-Elmer 16 U monochrometer with appropriate\n      gratings and order filters.  A globar at 1400 K was used in the\n      2-25 micrometer range; shortward of 2.0 micrometers a tungsten\n      source at 2700 K was used.  The reference detector was a\n      thermocouple for all but the 0.4-1.1 micrometer range, where a\n      calibrated silicon photodiode was used.  Out-of-band\n      measurements were made by replacing the spectrometer grating\n      with a plane mirror and ir materials having known cutoff and\n      cuton wavelengths.  Flux calibration of the IRTM was performed\n      under a simulated space environment using a vacuum chamber\n      operated typically at a pressure of 1.E-6 Torr.  The IRTM was\n      operated by means of a console which simulated the interfaces\n      and functions of the spacecraft FDS.  A minicomputer was used\n      to provide all operational sequences and modes.  Data were\n      recorded on magnetic tape for subsequent computer processing.\n      The calibration fixture consisted of two identical blackbodies,\n      one located in front of the space port and maintained at liquid\n      nitrogen temperature and the other in front of the planet port\n      and adjustable in temperature from 77 K to 350K; eleven\n      settings from 140 K to 330 K were used.  Blackbody temperatures\n      were measured with platinum resistance thermometers having an\n      absolute accuracy of +/- 0.1 degrees C.  traceable to the\n      National Bureau of Standards.  The digitizer used in the test\n      console provided ten times the resolution of the FDS digitizer,\n      thus making the digitizing uncertainty during calibration\n      insignificant compared to the noise.  The calibration data thus\n      produced are IRTM output in digitization level (DN) as a\n      function of blackbody temperature.  Radiometrically measured\n      internal reference surface temperatures showed close agreement\n      (+/- 0.5 degrees C.) with those measured independently with a\n      thermister.  The IRTM temperature was controlled by regulating\n      the temperature of a mounting base plate and the thermal shield\n      inside the vacuum chamber.  Calibration was performed at 10\n      degrees C.  spacing across the range of operating temperatures\n      expected during flight.  Typical IRTM channel response to scene\n      brightness temperatures is shown in Fig.  8 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n      The one-sample noise on the thermal channels is less than 1 DN\n      except for the 15 micrometer channel where it is about 2.5 DN.\n      The dynamic ranges of the surface thermal bands are based on\n      temperatures expected for the Martian surface.  The 300 K\n      maximum chosen for the A telescope might be exceeded by midday\n      summer temperatures, but temperatures above the 310-K limit of\n      the B telescope should not be exceeded unless active volcanic\n      areas were found; temperatures to 320 K and 330 K could be\n      measured by the 9 micrometer and 7 micrometer bands.  The 15\n      micrometer band dynamic range was set quite large as its\n      resolution is noise limited rather than digitization limited.\n      Telescope D channels were calibrated using a different method.\n      The radiance source was a mercury-xenon lamp and narrowband\n      filter centered at 0.896 micrometer with a bandwidth of 425 nm.\n      The in-band radiance of the lamp was known by direct comparison\n      with a standard lamp acquired from the National Bureau of\n      Standards, using a silicon photodiode as a transfer standard.\n      The relative spectral response measurements then allowed\n      extension of the one-point absolute calibration to the entire\n      passband.  Gains for the D channels were set to give full scale\n      for 75% of the diffuse reflection of solar irradiance at Mars\n      average distance from the sun.  Using integrals of the Planck\n      function and the measured spectral response, the flux response\n      of the IRTM is found to be close to linear in the thermal\n      channels.  The best fit quadratic functions, normalized to full\n      scale, typically had constant and quadratic coefficients of\n      0.002 and 0.02, respectively.  The solar band channels, which\n      had much higher absolute flux levels at full scale, showed a\n      decrease in response at high signal levels corresponding to a\n      quadratic coefficient of 0.07.  With the IRTM in the vacuum\n      chamber, the instrument response was measured at four lamp\n      currents.  An additional series of wide band measurements\n      utilizing a NBS standard lamp and a barium sulfate diffusing\n      screen, in which only the lamp-screen distance was changed, was\n      used to determine in detail the solar band nonlinearity.\n      During spacecraft thermal-vacuum testing and in flight, a small\n      drift of about 1-min duration was found to be induced when the\n      scan mirror moved to the reference position in normal mode.\n      This appears to be caused by the decrease in radiative heat\n      loss from the instrument when the telescopes do not view space.\n      The shape of this postreference drift was accurately determined\n      during normal mode sequences when the spacecraft was well away\n      from Mars, and this effect is removed in the data reduction.\n      The change of the thermal state of the IRTM caused by large\n      scan platform slew or planetary radiation near periapsis can\n      introduce significant drifts of the zero-flux level.  These\n      shifts have a time constant of 1-2 min or longer, and their\n      magnitude increases with inband wavelength and preamplifier\n      gain.  It is probably due primarily to very small temperature\n      gradients induced in the detector packages as the general\n      instrument temperature changes.  A significant design feature\n      of the IRTM is that the space DN level of each channel is\n      measured immediately prior to and after the restore which\n      occurs each minute in normal mode.  A linear interpolation\n      between these zero-flux DN levels is used in data\n      decalibration.  The remaining quadratic and higher order drift\n      is generally negligible.\n \n \n    Section 'IRTM'\n    ==============\n      Total Fovs                     : 7\n      Data Rate                      : 250.000000\n      Sample Bits                    : 10\n \n \n      'IRTM' Detectors\n      ----------------\n        A\n \n \n      'IRTM' Electronics\n      ------------------\n        IRTM\n \n \n      'IRTM' Filters\n      --------------\n        SOLAR UV-22\n        T11\n        T15\n        T20\n        T7\n        T9\n \n \n      'IRTM' Section Optic IDs\n      ------------------------\n        A\n        B\n        C\n        D\n \n \n      In modes\n      --------\n        FIXED PLANET\n        FIXED REFERENCE\n        FIXED SPACE\n        MODIFIED NORMAL\n        NORMAL\n \n \n      'IRTM' Section FOV Shape 'CIRCULAR'\n      -----------------------------------\n        Section Id                     : IRTM\n        Fovs                           : 7\n        Horizontal Pixel Fov           : 0.292000\n        Vertical Pixel Fov             : 0.292000\n        Horizontal Fov                 : 2.402000\n        Vertical Fov                   : 1.347000\n \n \n      'IRTM' Section Parameter 'RADIANCE A'\n      -------------------------------------\n        The A telescope measured wavelengths between 16 and 30\n        microns.

The\n        chevron arrangement was based on the need for uniform\n        coverage irrespective of scan platform orientation; it also\n        allowed the detectors to all be approximately the same\n        distance from the telescope optic axis.  In this application\n        thermopiles were found to be better than other thermal\n        detectors because they operate to dc and exhibit no 1/f\n        noise.  Thus, no optical chopper is needed.  Also, no bias\n        supply, another potential source of 1/f noise, is needed.\n        Cooled quantum detectors were not practical, considering the\n        duration and weight constraints of the Viking Mission.  The\n        array was made by evaporating the various components onto a\n        sapphire film using photoetched masks for dimensional\n        control.  The film, about 200 nm thick, is supported by a\n        sapphire disk.  The film was made by anodizing aluminum foil\n        and etching away the aluminum.  The black circular dots in\n        the figure are the sensitive areas overlaid with bismuth\n        mass.

At\n        other times the detector packages were backfilled with xenon\n        to protect the detectors while still allowing gross\n        sensitivity checks.  To avoid exposure to moisture during the\n        long period prior to launch when the IRTM was mounted on the\n        spacecraft and could not be sealed, the manifold was kept at\n        a slight positive pressure by a continuous flow of high\n        purity nitrogen.  The manifold was opened to space by launch\n        vehicle separation.\n \n \n      Sensitivity\n      -----------\n        The detectivity is 2.E8 CM_HZ**0.5_W**-1\n \n \n    Instrument Electronics 'IRTM'\n    =============================\n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The signal channels use a synchronous demodulation scheme to\n        provide good stability and to avoid 1/f noise in the preamp.\n        The input FET chopper is a full-wave type operating at 471\n        Hz.  This and the center-tapped thermopile allow voltage\n        doubling of the detector signal and noise and thus reduce the\n        preamp noise contribution which otherwise would be\n        significant.  The differential input connection, while\n        suffering a square root (2) noise disadvantage compared to\n        single-ended input, provides excellent common mode rejection\n        of chopper spikes and other input noise.  Temperature\n        dependence of the thermopile, about -0.5%/degree C., is\n        compensated by a thermister network external to the hybrid\n        package.  Preamp gain is adjustable with an external\n        resistor.  Following the half-wave synchronous demodulator is\n        an integrate, hold, and reset circuit with an integrate time\n        of 981 msec.  The integrator serves as a low pass filter\n        while the hold feature ensures spatial simultaneity of\n        corresponding detectors in each telescope.  After completion\n        of sampling by the multiplexer, all channel hold circuits are\n        reset to ensure independence of data samples.  The IRTM\n        analog signals, which have a range of +/- 6V, are digitized\n        by the analog-to-pulse width converter and flight data\n        subsystem (FDS) counter into +/- 2**9 levels, yielding 1023\n        data numbers (DN) which are nearly linear with radiance in\n        each channel.  The IRTM multiplexer consists of sixty-eight\n        FET switches and a buffer signal amplifier.  In addition to\n        thirty-two data channels (twenty-eight active and four\n        spare), thirty-two channels of engineering data are also\n        sample.  These include eight temperature measurements from\n        thermisters located at four locations on the reference plate,\n        the electronics module, and each of the three ir detector\n        packages (telescopes A, B, C).  Three power supply voltages\n        and the pre-dc restore voltage of twenty-one channels\n        (telescopes A, B, and C) are monitored.  The pre-dc restore\n        monitors are diagnostic to determine the presence of large\n        thermal or detector offsets.  The scan mirror is driven by a\n        four-position stepper motor through a 50/1 gear reduction.  A\n        motor drive pulse duration of 40 msec allows a 90 degree\n        mirror rotation in 2 sec.  The mirror position is sensed by a\n        two-bit encoder on the motor shaft; the contacts at the three\n        desired positions are about half of the width of 1.8 degree\n        mirror step.  The motor stepping is controlled by the FDS\n        using a comparison of the encoder readout with the desired\n        position originating either from the FDS normal mode clock or\n        direct ground command; the motor cannot be directly\n        commanded.  In addition to the restore which occurs\n        automatically in the normal model when the mirror reaches the\n        space position, restores can be ground commanded when the\n        IRTM is in the fixed planet or fixed space mode; in either\n        case housekeeping data are multiplexed into the data stream\n        during the 1-sec restore period.  Whenever the mirror reaches\n        the reference position, the calibration lamp is turned on for\n        the next two integration periods.  The lamp is at full\n        radiance throughout the second integration period, which is\n        used for gain determination of the D telescope channels.

The\n        digitizer used in the test console provided ten times the\n        resolution of the FDS digitizer, thus making the digitizing\n        uncertainty during calibration insignificant compared to the\n        noise.

The 15 micrometer\n        band dynamic range was set quite large as its resolution is\n        noise limited rather than digitization limited.\n \n \n    Instrument Optics 'A'\n    =====================\n      Telescope Diameter             : 0.058000\n      Telescope F Number             : 3.500000\n      Telescope Focal Length         : 0.203000\n      Telescope Resolution           : 0.005100\n      Telescope T Number             : UNK\n      Telescope Transmittance        : UNK\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The A telescope (17.7-24 micrometer) is shown schematically\n        in Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  It is an f/3.5, 20.3-cm focal\n        length Cassegrainian design with an aperture diameter of\n        5.8-cm., spherical surfaces, and, except for mirror\n        materials, is identical to the B and C telescopes.  By using\n        relatively slow fore optics, degradation of filter sharpness\n        normally caused by operating an interference filter in a low\n        f-number beam is negligible.  The focal plane contains a\n        field-defining aperture plate with seven 0.107-cm diameter\n        holes arranged in a chevron pattern.  The fields of view thus\n        defined are nested with those of the MAWD and imaging systems\n        (Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978).  Behind each hole in the field\n        stop plate is a lens which produces a 0.0254-cm diam image of\n        the telescope aperture on the detector, which itself is about\n        the same size.  The final optical speed at the detector is\n        f/1.  Optical materials used in the four telescopes are shown\n        in Table II, and the resulting spectral response is shown in\n        Fig.  5 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  Mirrors are made of hot-pressed\n        uncoated zinc oxide for both primary and secondary mirrors.\n        The reststrahlen reflection properties of ZnO are the major\n        factors in the A telescope spectral response.  Minimizing\n        extrafield sensitivity (EFS) was an important aspect of the\n        optical design since on previous Mariner radiometers EFS\n        contribution seriously compromised observations of scenes\n        near large temperature contrasts (points near the planetary\n        limb and polar caps).  During instrumentation development,\n        IRTM image quality was determined in two angular regions.  In\n        the near-field region, a laboratory collimator and ir source\n        were used to measure the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad\n        diam (three fields of view).  Point source field of view\n        measurements in this region are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far field measurements, sensitivity\n        constraints dictated an approach in which the fraction of\n        energy within a given angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm\n        diam, concentric grooved, blackbody plate with a series of\n        restricting apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm,\n        140-cm, and 610-cm) to define angular response regions from\n        about one field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the\n        telescope focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at\n        that distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2\n        mrad).  The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a\n        heater/regulator and integral water jacket.  To prevent\n        difficulties with atmospheric transmission, the entire\n        apparatus was contained in a polyethylene bag flushed with\n        dry N2.  The EFS problem was more severe for the longer\n        wavelength A telescope than the others, possibly owing to the\n        higher reflectance at longer wavelengths of the black paint\n        used inside the telescope.  Tests using this apparatus led to\n        several telescope modifications designed to reduce EFS (see\n        Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal baffle was\n        placed between the field lens and the detectors to confine\n        energy to the sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A spider\n        baffle, added to the outer edges of the secondary mirror\n        support spider, was designed to reduce reflection off the\n        sides of the spider legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with CTL\n        15 black paint was placed on the central dead spot of the\n        secondary mirror.  This was designed to prevent focal plane\n        reflections from falling on the detectors.  Of these three\n        modifications, only the cone baffle gave significant\n        improvement, although all three were incorporated in the\n        design.  These results of the final EFS measurements are\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response\n        due to diffraction and the measured values are shown.  The\n        integrated EFS response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was\n        about 4%.  Of this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.\n        The effect of response outside of the nominal field of view\n        can be estimated directly from data obtained on scans across\n        the hot (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the\n        response is circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates\n        this to be closely followed, the signature of a half space\n        would also be symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived\n        from a Viking 1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was\n        determined using a 20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate\n        all four telescopes with a small source of high temperature\n        blackbody radiation.  Measurements were taken simultaneously\n        in twenty-eight channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.\n        For each channel, a parabolic ellipsoid was fit to data where\n        the measured intensity was more than 10% of the peak\n        intensity in that channel.  The alignment of each telescope\n        was ascertained by combining the center of response so\n        determined for the seven channels in the telescope.  This\n        procedure allowed for the alignment of the four telescopes to\n        be determined with an estimated precision of 0.1 mrad.  The\n        back of the secondary mirror of the B telescope was\n        aluminized and used as the alignment reference for this\n        procedure and for instrument alignment on the spacecraft.\n        The instrument pointing direction was verified in the same\n        manner just prior to planetary encounter using Mars as a\n        5-mrad diam source and using the science platform motion to\n        generate a 5-mrad spaced grid.

The spectral bandpass of the other ir\n        channels is determined by interference bandpass filters and\n        AR coated detector lenses.  The transmission elements of the\n        D telescope insure that it is thermally blind.  Special\n        coatings on the D telescope mirrors were used to obtain a\n        reasonably gray response to solar radiation.  Minimizing\n        extrafield sensitivity (EFS) was an important aspect of the\n        optical design since on previous Mariner radiometers EFS\n        contribution seriously compromised observations of scenes\n        near large temperature contrasts (points near the planetary\n        limb and polar caps).  During instrumentation development,\n        IRTM image quality was determined in two angular regions.  In\n        the near-field region, a laboratory collimator and ir source\n        were used to measure the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad\n        diam (three fields of view).  Point source field of view\n        measurements in this region are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far field measurements, sensitivity\n        constraints dictated an approach in which the fraction of\n        energy within a given angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm\n        diam, concentric grooved, blackbody plate with a series of\n        restricting apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm,\n        140-cm, and 610-cm) to define angular response regions from\n        about one field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the\n        telescope focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at\n        that distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2\n        mrad).  The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a\n        heater/regulator and integral water jacket.  To prevent\n        difficulties with atmospheric transmission, the entire\n        apparatus was contained in a polyethylene bag flushed with\n        dry N2.  The EFS problem was more severe for the longer\n        wavelength A telescope than the others, possibly owing to the\n        higher reflectance at longer wavelengths of the black paint\n        used inside the telescope.  Tests using this apparatus led to\n        several telescope modifications designed to reduce EFS (see\n        Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal baffle was\n        placed between the field lens and the detectors to confine\n        energy to the sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A spider\n        baffle, added to the outer edges of the secondary mirror\n        support spider, was designed to reduce reflection off the\n        sides of the spider legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with CTL\n        15 black paint was placed on the central dead spot of the\n        secondary mirror.  This was designed to prevent focal plane\n        reflections from falling on the detectors.  Of these three\n        modifications, only the cone baffle gave significant\n        improvement, although all three were incorporated in the\n        design.  These results of the final EFS measurements are\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response\n        due to diffraction and the measured values are shown.  The\n        integrated EFS response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was\n        about 4%.  Of this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.\n        The effect of response outside of the nominal field of view\n        can be estimated directly from data obtained on scans across\n        the hot (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the\n        response is circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates\n        this to be closely followed, the signature of a half space\n        would also be symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived\n        from a Viking 1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was\n        determined using a 20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate\n        all four telescopes with a small source of high temperature\n        blackbody radiation.  Measurements were taken simultaneously\n        in twenty-eight channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.\n        For each channel, a parabolic ellipsoid was fit to data where\n        the measured intensity was more than 10% of the peak\n        intensity in that channel.  The alignment of each telescope\n        was ascertained by combining the center of response so\n        determined for the seven channels in the telescope.  This\n        procedure allowed by the alignment of the four telescopes to\n        be determined with an estimated precision of 0.1 mrad.  The\n        instrument pointing direction was verified in the same manner\n        just prior to planetary encounter using Mars as a 5-mrad diam\n        source and using the science platform motion to generate a\n        5-mrad spaced grid.  The in-flight alignment is shown in Fig.\n        4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n \n \n    Instrument Mode 'FIXED PLANET'\n    ==============================\n      Instrument Power Consumption : 6.000000\n \n \n      In sections\n      -----------\n        IRTM\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        Other than power on or power off, the only command options\n        for the IRTM controlled the motion of the scan mirror.

In NORMAL mode, ICKs 1 and 2 were\n        housekeeping data while the mirror moved to space.  ICK 3 was\n        the space level before reset.  During ICK 4, the electronics\n        for all channels were reset so that the sensed radiance\n        (meant to be the cosmic background level of essentially zero\n        radiance) yielded a data number (DN) of a few.  There was a\n        filter on the reset so that the voltage change was only about\n        2/3 of the way to the space radiance level; this smoothed out\n        the zero setting, but also meant that several cycles were\n        required to recover from a serious drift.

ICKs 10 through 13 were housekeeping\n        data while the mirror moved to the planet position.  The 57\n        ICKs 14-64 were planet data.

ICK is a one syllable\n        acronym for 'incremental counter keeper' and represents 1.12\n        second duration, the basic time interval of IRTM operation.\n        It required 2 ICKs for the mirror to move 90 degrees and\n        settle; whenever the mirror was in motion the downlink data\n        contained housekeeping information about instrument status\n        and detector voltage levels.

The MAWD instrument is a fixed grating\n      spectrometer having five channels centered on three absorption\n      lines and two continuum regions between these lines.  All\n      channels utilize PbS detectors; the spectral resolution of each\n      is about 1.2 cm**-1.  The instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of\n      the detectors is 0.96 by 0.12 degree.  The IFOV can be\n      step-scanned perpendicular to its long dimension through\n      fifteen positions by a raster mirror incorporated in the\n      optical train.  The time spent at each step (approximately the\n      signal integration time) is 280 milliseconds, and the duration\n      of the raster is 4.48 seconds.  The combination of the motions\n      of the raster mirror, the orbiter scan platform, and the\n      orbital ground track generates sets of slew patterns over the\n      planet's surface.  A basic description of the instrument, its\n      observational modes and its derived data products is given in\n      FARMER_ETAL_1977.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      There are two major objectives of the Viking MAWD experiments.\n      The first of these is to map, during the far encounter and\n      preliminary orbital phases, the distribution of water vapor\n      over the planet, and in this way perform the vital initial\n      function of investigating prospective lading sites with respect\n      to this particular characteristic.  The second objective is\n      concerned with the nature of the water vapor cycle itself and\n      the relationship between the martian atmospheric and surface or\n      subsurface water.  To this end, the observations are designed\n      to investigate spatial, diurnal, and seasonal variations of\n      water vapor with high spatial and temporal resolutions.  A\n      basic description of the instrument, its observational modes\n      and its derived data products is given in FARMER_ETAL_1977.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Viking Orbiter 2 did not jettison its bioshield as planned,\n      making it impossible for MAWD to view the calibration plate.\n      Thus, no inflight calibrations were possible for the VO2 MAWD.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The precise frequency location of the various channels is\n      maintained against possible shifts due to thermal distortion of\n      the instrument's optical alignment by a monochromatic neon\n      reference system, using a set of silicon photodiodes as\n      detectors.  Motion of the neon lamp exit plane image with\n      respect to the silicon reference detectors is sensed and used\n      to drive a cam which repositions the grating to preserve the\n      correct wavelength alignment.  The channel responses are\n      corrected by means of periodic calibrations made by inserting a\n      mirror into the input beam so that the detectors view a\n      sunlight-illuminated diffusely reflecting plate mounted on a\n      structural member of the spacecraft.\n \n \n    Section 'MAWD'\n    ==============\n      Total Fovs                     : 15\n      Data Rate

The camera system is commonly called the Visual\n      Imaging Subsystem (VIS).  Each camera consists of a telescope,\n      a slow scan vidicon, a filter wheel, and associated\n      electronics.  The filter wheel contains blue, minus blue,\n      violet, clear, green, and red filters.  The angular field of\n      view as defined by the reseau pattern is 1.51 by 1.69 degrees.\n      Since the scan lines go beyond the reseau pattern in the line\n      direction the active field of view is about 1.54 degrees in\n      this direction.  The actual ground area covered by an image\n      varies as a function of spacecraft altitude and emission angle.\n      The digital image is generated by scanning the vidicon face\n      plate.  The signal is digitized as a 7-bit number.  The image\n      contains 1056 horizontal lines.  There are 1182 samples in each\n      line exposed to incoming light.  The vidicon samples 11 pixels\n      on either side of the raster onto an opaque mask located at the\n      front of each vidicon.  Hence, 1204 samples per line are\n      telemetered to Earth, but only 1182 contain information.  Each\n      camera can be commanded to acquire an image every 8.96 seconds.\n      By alternating cameras, an image can be taken every 4.48\n      seconds.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The first objective of the imaging system was to characterize\n      potential landing sites in support of site selection.\n      Additional objectives of the imaging system were to study the\n      photometric and colorimetric properties of the surface\n      discovered by Mariner 9 in order to better understand the\n      geological history of Mars atmosphere.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Each Viking Orbiter camera contained a filter wheel with five\n      filters and a clear position, i.e., no filter.  An image could\n      be acquired using one of the six filters types, which included\n      blue, minus blue, violet, clear, green, and red.  The filter\n      wheel could be stepped only one position between each exposure.\n      Three mode parameters or camera states could be set for a given\n      exposure.  There was the light flood condition flag.  Light\n      flooding was used to reduce the residual image from the\n      previous exposure.  Eight small incandescent bulbs exposed the\n      vidicon beyond saturation.  There were also two gain states:\n      low and high.  The high gain state increased the gain by a\n      factor of 2.  There was also an exposure offset that would\n      provide a positive signal (DN) from the camera even for a zero\n      exposure.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal\n      received from the camera (DN value) into a quantity that is\n      proportional to the radiance reaching the sensor.  The\n      sensitivity of the vidicon varies across the field of view.\n      The sensitivity of the vidicon also varies with time.  Each\n      Viking Orbiter imaging instrument was calibrated before flight.\n      In addition, changes in the calibration over time have been\n      estimated from analyses of images of deep space and dust\n      storms.  The radiometric calibration applies additive and\n      multiplicative corrections that account for the varying\n      sensitivity of the vidicon.  The resulting values are\n      proportional to radiance factor, which is defined as the ratio\n      of the observed radiance to the radiance of a normally\n      illuminated lambertian reflector of unit reflectance at the\n      same heliocentric distance.  The geometric calibration removes\n      electronic distortions and transforms the point perspective\n      geometry of the original image into a map projection.  The\n      electronic distortions are barrel- shaped distortions from the\n      electron beam readout and complex distortions from interactions\n      between the charge on the vidicon face plate and the electron\n      beam.  The electronic distortions are modeled by comparing the\n      undistorted locations of reseau marks with the actual locations\n      in an image.\n \n \n    Section 'VISA'\n    ==============\n      Total Fovs                     : 1\n      Data Rate                      : 2112000.000000\n      Sample Bits                    : 7\n \n \n      'VISA' Detectors\n      ----------------\n        VISA\n \n \n      'VISA' Electronics\n      ------------------\n        VISA\n \n \n      'VISA' Filters\n      --------------\n        BLUE\n        CLEAR\n        GREEN\n        MINUS BLUE\n        RED\n        VIOLET\n \n \n      'VISA' Section Optic IDs\n      ------------------------\n        VISA\n \n \n      In modes\n      --------\n        ...\n        ..D\n        .G.\n        .GD\n        L..\n        L.D\n        LG.\n        LGD\n \n \n      'VISA' Section FOV Shape 'RECTANGULAR'\n      --------------------------------------\n        Section Id                     : VISA\n        Fovs                           : 1\n        Horizontal Pixel Fov           : 0.001420\n        Vertical Pixel Fov             : 0.001420\n        Horizontal Fov                 : 1.692000\n        Vertical Fov                   : 1.543000\n \n \n      'VISA' Section Parameter 'RADIANCE'\n      -----------------------------------\n        Radiance is the amount of energy per time per projected area\n        per steradian.\n \n        Instrument Parameter Name      : RADIANCE\n        Sampling Parameter Name        : PIXEL\n        Instrument Parameter Unit      : WATT/(METER*METER)/STERADIAN\n        Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 0.001420\n        Sampling Parameter Unit        : DEGREE\n \n \n    Instrument Detector 'VISA'\n    ==========================\n      Detector Type                  : VIDICON\n      Detector Aspect Ratio          : 1.120000\n      Minimum Wavelength             : 0.350000\n      Maximum Wavelength             : 0.650000\n      Nominal Operating Temperature  : 288.000000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The VIS detector is a Westinghouse 5166 selenium vidicon.

The camera system is commonly called the Visual\n      Imaging Subsystem (VIS).  Each camera consists of a telescope,\n      a slow scan vidicon, a filter wheel, and associated\n      electronics.  The filter wheel contains blue, minus blue,\n      violet, clear, green, and red filters.  The angular field of\n      view as defined by the reseau pattern is 1.51 by 1.69 degrees.\n      Since the scan lines go beyond the reseau pattern in the line\n      direction the active field of view is about 1.54 degrees in\n      this direction.  The actual ground area covered by an image\n      varies as a function of spacecraft altitude and emission angle.\n      The digital image is generated by scanning the vidicon face\n      plate.  The signal is digitized as a 7-bit number.  The image\n      contains 1056 horizontal lines.  There are 1182 samples in each\n      line exposed to incoming light.  The vidicon samples 11 pixels\n      on either side of the raster onto an opaque mask located at the\n      front of each vidicon.  Hence, 1204 samples per line are\n      telemetered to Earth, but only 1182 contain information.  Each\n      camera can be commanded to acquire an image every 8.96 seconds.\n      By alternating cameras, an image can be taken every 4.48\n      seconds.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The first objective of the imaging system was to characterize\n      potential landing sites in support of site selection.\n      Additional objectives of the imaging system were to study the\n      photometric and colorimetric properties of the surface\n      discovered by Mariner 9 in order to better understand the\n      geological history of Mars atmosphere.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Each Viking Orbiter camera contained a filter wheel with five\n      filters and a clear position, i.e., no filter.  An image could\n      be acquired using one of the six filters types, which included\n      blue, minus blue, violet, clear, green, and red.  The filter\n      wheel could be stepped only one position between each exposure.\n      Three mode parameters or camera states could be set for a given\n      exposure.  There was the light flood condition flag.  Light\n      flooding was used to reduce the residual image from the\n      previous exposure.  Eight small incandescent bulbs exposed the\n      vidicon beyond saturation.  There were also two gain states:\n      low and high.  The high gain state increased the gain by a\n      factor of 2.  There was also an exposure offset that would\n      provide a positive signal (DN) from the camera even for a zero\n      exposure.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal\n      received from the camera (DN value) into a quantity that is\n      proportional to the radiance reaching the sensor.  The\n      sensitivity of the vidicon varies across the field of view.\n      The sensitivity of the vidicon also varies with time.  Each\n      Viking Orbiter imaging instrument was calibrated before flight.\n      In addition, changes in the calibration over time have been\n      estimated from analyses of images of deep space and dust\n      storms.  The radiometric calibration applies additive and\n      multiplicative corrections that account for the varying\n      sensitivity of the vidicon.  The resulting values are\n      proportional to radiance factor, which is defined as the ratio\n      of the observed radiance to the radiance of a normally\n      illuminated lambertian reflector of unit reflectance at the\n      same heliocentric distance.  The geometric calibration removes\n      electronic distortions and transforms the point perspective\n      geometry of the original image into a map projection.  The\n      electronic distortions are barrel- shaped distortions from the\n      electron beam readout and complex distortions from interactions\n      between the charge on the vidicon face plate and the electron\n      beam.  The electronic distortions are modeled by comparing the\n      undistorted locations of reseau marks with the actual locations\n      in an image.\n \n \n    Section 'VISB'\n    ==============\n      Total Fovs                     : 1\n      Data Rate                      : 2112000.000000\n      Sample Bits                    : 7\n \n \n      'VISB' Detectors\n      ----------------\n        VISB\n \n \n      'VISB' Electronics\n      ------------------\n        VISB\n \n \n      'VISB' Filters\n      --------------\n        BLUE\n        CLEAR\n        GREEN\n        MINUS BLUE\n        RED\n        VIOLET\n \n \n      'VISB' Section Optic IDs\n      ------------------------\n        VISB\n \n \n      In modes\n      --------\n        ...\n        ..D\n        .G.\n        .GD\n        L..\n        L.D\n        LG.\n        LGD\n \n \n      'VISB' Section FOV Shape 'RECTANGULAR'\n      --------------------------------------\n        Section Id                     : VISB\n        Fovs                           : 1\n        Horizontal Pixel Fov           : 0.001420\n        Vertical Pixel Fov             : 0.001420\n        Horizontal Fov                 : 1.693000\n        Vertical Fov                   : 1.538000\n \n \n      'VISB' Section Parameter 'RADIANCE'\n      -----------------------------------\n        Radiance is the amount of energy per time per projected area\n        per steradian.\n \n        Instrument Parameter Name      : RADIANCE\n        Sampling Parameter Name        : PIXEL\n        Instrument Parameter Unit      : WATT/(METER*METER)/STERADIAN\n        Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 0.001420\n        Sampling Parameter Unit        : DEGREE\n \n \n    Instrument Detector 'VISB'\n    ==========================\n      Detector Type                  : VIDICON\n      Detector Aspect Ratio          : 1.120000\n      Minimum Wavelength             : 0.350000\n      Maximum Wavelength             : 0.650000\n      Nominal Operating Temperature  : 288.000000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The VIS detector is a Westinghouse 5166 selenium vidicon.

There is a total of\n      twenty-eight channels in four surface and one atmospheric\n      thermal band from 6 micrometer to 30 micrometer and a broad\n      solar reflectance band.  All channels are sampled\n      simultaneously, using the spacecraft scanning capability to map\n      the radiance over small and large areas of the planet.  All\n      channels use thermopile detectors; spectral passbands are\n      determined by a combination of interference filters, detector\n      lens materials, antireflection coatings, and reststrahlen\n      optics.  The scan modes are described in the PDS INSTRUMENT\n      MODE DESCRIPTION.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The objective of the Viking Orbiter infrared thermal mapper\n      (IRTM) is to measure the thermal emission of the Martian\n      surface and atmosphere and total reflected sunlight with high\n      spatial and flux resolution.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Most low and moderate resolution IRTM data were acquired\n      through using 'box scans'.  These were commonly acquired\n      between 1-6 hours from periapsis, and utilized the scan\n      platform to slew back and forth in cone angle (in the direction\n      the IRTM chevron points) with small offsets in the same\n      direction between these oscillating slews.  Ignoring spacecraft\n      motion, this pattern would generate bi-directional evenly\n      spaced scans with the seven IRTM detectors.  Spacecraft motion\n      during the scan sequence, typically of 10-40 minutes duration,\n      created some distortion in this otherwise uniform pattern.\n      Typical resulting scans across the planetary surface are shown\n      in Figure 3 of Kieffer et al., 1976.  These scans were usually\n      designed to extend slightly off the limb of the planet on at\n      least one side.  These 'planet port' off-planet data provided\n      the best estimates of the zero radiance response of the\n      instrument.  When the spacecraft was near periapsis, the\n      apparent motion of the planetary surface relative to the\n      spacecraft was too rapid to allow oscillating slews.  At these\n      times, the instrument would simply 'stare' in one direction and\n      use the spacecraft motion to sweep the detector pattern across\n      the surface.  These observations were usually acquired in\n      Normal Mode, but occasionally Fixed Planet was used.  At\n      irregular times through the mission, 'phase function'\n      observations were made.  These involved using the two axis scan\n      platform to follow one point on the ground as the spacecraft\n      went from horizon to horizon relative to this surface point.\n      In actuality, this sequence was acquired using a small number\n      of discrete scan platform moves, allowing the instrument to\n      'stare' across a short stripe centered on the target point\n      between slews.  Such 'phase function' observations typically\n      yielded about 10 different viewing geometries within a single\n      sequence.  These observations were particularly useful in\n      determining the influence of the atmosphere.  In preparation of\n      the IRTM data set, all observations which were more than 1 1/2\n      degrees apparent angle above the nearest limb of the planet\n      were deleted.\n \n      Geometry Errors Due to Uncertain Timing: Early and late during\n      the Viking mission, orbital solutions based on the tracking\n      telemetry were determined every few days.  During VO-1\n      revolution 175-603 and VO-2 revolutions 118-521, orbital\n      solutions were often separated by a week or more.  Because\n      there is significant irregularity in the Martian gravitional\n      field, these irregularities could slowly influence the orbit of\n      the Viking spacecraft in unpredictable ways.  The primary\n      influence was in the period of the orbit, resulting in\n      uncertainty as to exactly where the spacecraft was along its\n      orbit at any specific time.  These uncertainties were as large\n      as 75 seconds in the worst case.  Far from periapsis, these\n      timing uncertainties were not of major significance because the\n      spacecraft velocities were low and the projected fields of\n      views on the planet were large.  However, near periapsis, the\n      IRTM field of view could move across the surface equivalent to\n      its full width in as little as one second.  Thus, when there\n      was a large timing error, the computed ground intercept\n      locations could be in error by many fields of view.  In the\n      worst case, these positions may be in error by up to 200 km.\n      When the magnitude of this problem was discovered, the SEDR\n      (geometry calculations) for the imaging instrument was rerun\n      with revised orbit solutions.  However, it was impractical to\n      regenerate the IRTM SEDR and these errors have not been\n      corrected.  There was an attempt by the navigational team to\n      estimate the magnitude of the timing error for both Viking\n      spacecraft for those revolutions through the affected part of\n      the Viking mission.  This is described in the 1980 April 14\n      memo by Frank Palluconi, which contains estimates of the\n      magnitude of the error for each revolution.  Hugh Kieffer has a\n      copy (the sole surviving copy?) of this memo.  A direct\n      determination of the timing offset can be made from the IRTM\n      data alone in those instances when thermal patterns can be\n      unambiguously identified with surface features.  Since the\n      dominant geometric error is in time, maps of thermal patterns\n      (typically as contours of observed temperature minus the\n      calculated standard model temperature) can be slid across the\n      cartographic map parallel to the subspacecraft track (if the\n      instrument was in fixed planet mode, this is simply sliding the\n      IRTM trace along its own path) until the thermal and\n      cartographic features are aligned.  Because there are small\n      gaps in the IRTM coverage every 64 ICKs, the amount the IRTM\n      pattern must be shifted to agree with the surface morphology\n      can be scaled directly into a timing offset in seconds.  This\n      has been done for a variety of high resolution scans across\n      Arsia Mons (by Jim Zimbelman) and for many scans across Valles\n      Marineris (by David Paige and Hugh Kieffer).  A set of known\n      offsets is slowly accumulating.  Hugh Kieffer has a copy (the\n      sole surviving copy?) of the memo discussing this problem.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      Relative spectral response of all channels was measured end to\n      end using a Perkin-Elmer 16 U monochrometer with appropriate\n      gratings and order filters.  A globar at 1400 K was used in the\n      2-25 micrometer range; shortward of 2.0 micrometers a tungsten\n      source at 2700 K was used.  The reference detector was a\n      thermocouple for all but the 0.4-1.1 micrometer range, where a\n      calibrated silicon photodiode was used.  Out-of-band\n      measurements were made by replacing the spectrometer grating\n      with a plane mirror and ir materials having known cutoff and\n      cuton wavelengths.  Flux calibration of the IRTM was performed\n      under a simulated space environment using a vacuum chamber\n      operated typically at a pressure of 1.E-6 Torr.  The IRTM was\n      operated by means of a console which simulated the interfaces\n      and functions of the spacecraft FDS.  A minicomputer was used\n      to provide all operational sequences and modes.  Data were\n      recorded on magnetic tape for subsequent computer processing.\n      The calibration fixture consisted of two identical blackbodies,\n      one located in front of the space port and maintained at liquid\n      nitrogen temperature and the other in front of the planet port\n      and adjustable in temperature from 77 K to 350K; eleven\n      settings from 140 K to 330 K were used.  Blackbody temperatures\n      were measured with platinum resistance thermometers having an\n      absolute accuracy of +/- 0.1 degrees C.  traceable to the\n      National Bureau of Standards.  The digitizer used in the test\n      console provided ten times the resolution of the FDS digitizer,\n      thus making the digitizing uncertainty during calibration\n      insignificant compared to the noise.  The calibration data thus\n      produced are IRTM output in digitization level (DN) as a\n      function of blackbody temperature.  Radiometrically measured\n      internal reference surface temperatures showed close agreement\n      (+/- 0.5 degrees C.) with those measured independently with a\n      thermister.  The IRTM temperature was controlled by regulating\n      the temperature of a mounting base plate and the thermal shield\n      inside the vacuum chamber.  Calibration was performed at 10\n      degrees C.  spacing across the range of operating temperatures\n      expected during flight.  Typical IRTM channel response to scene\n      brightness temperatures is shown in Fig.  8 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n      The one-sample noise on the thermal channels is less than 1 DN\n      except for the 15 micrometer channel where it is about 2.5 DN.\n      The dynamic ranges of the surface thermal bands are based on\n      temperatures expected for the Martian surface.  The 300 K\n      maximum chosen for the A telescope might be exceeded by midday\n      summer temperatures, but temperatures above the 310-K limit of\n      the B telescope should not be exceeded unless active volcanic\n      areas were found; temperatures to 320 K and 330 K could be\n      measured by the 9 micrometer and 7 micrometer bands.  The 15\n      micrometer band dynamic range was set quite large as its\n      resolution is noise limited rather than digitization limited.\n      Telescope D channels were calibrated using a different method.\n      The radiance source was a mercury-xenon lamp and narrowband\n      filter centered at 0.896 micrometer with a bandwidth of 425 nm.\n      The in-band radiance of the lamp was known by direct comparison\n      with a standard lamp acquired from the National Bureau of\n      Standards, using a silicon photodiode as a transfer standard.\n      The relative spectral response measurements then allowed\n      extension of the one-point absolute calibration to the entire\n      passband.  Gains for the D channels were set to give full scale\n      for 75% of the diffuse reflection of solar irradiance at Mars\n      average distance from the sun.  Using integrals of the Planck\n      function and the measured spectral response, the flux response\n      of the IRTM is found to be close to linear in the thermal\n      channels.  The best fit quadratic functions, normalized to full\n      scale, typically had constant and quadratic coefficients of\n      0.002 and 0.02, respectively.  The solar band channels, which\n      had much higher absolute flux levels at full scale, showed a\n      decrease in response at high signal levels corresponding to a\n      quadratic coefficient of 0.07.  With the IRTM in the vacuum\n      chamber, the instrument response was measured at four lamp\n      currents.  An additional series of wide band measurements\n      utilizing a NBS standard lamp and a barium sulfate diffusing\n      screen, in which only the lamp-screen distance was changed, was\n      used to determine in detail the solar band nonlinearity.\n      During spacecraft thermal-vacuum testing and in flight, a small\n      drift of about 1-min duration was found to be induced when the\n      scan mirror moved to the reference position in normal mode.\n      This appears to be caused by the decrease in radiative heat\n      loss from the instrument when the telescopes do not view space.\n      The shape of this postreference drift was accurately determined\n      during normal mode sequences when the spacecraft was well away\n      from Mars, and this effect is removed in the data reduction.\n      The change of the thermal state of the IRTM caused by large\n      scan platform slew or planetary radiation near periapsis can\n      introduce significant drifts of the zero-flux level.  These\n      shifts have a time constant of 1-2 min or longer, and their\n      magnitude increases with inband wavelength and preamplifier\n      gain.  It is probably due primarily to very small temperature\n      gradients induced in the detector packages as the general\n      instrument temperature changes.  A significant design feature\n      of the IRTM is that the space DN level of each channel is\n      measured immediately prior to and after the restore which\n      occurs each minute in normal mode.  A linear interpolation\n      between these zero-flux DN levels is used in data\n      decalibration.

The\n        chevron arrangement was based on the need for uniform\n        coverage irrespective of scan platform orientation; it also\n        allowed the detectors to all be approximately the same\n        distance from the telescope optic axis.  In this application\n        thermopiles were found to be better than other thermal\n        detectors because they operate to dc and exhibit no 1/f\n        noise.  Thus, no optical chopper is needed.  Also, no bias\n        supply, another potential source of 1/f noise, is needed.\n        Cooled quantum detectors were not practical, considering the\n        duration and weight constraints of the Viking Mission.  The\n        array was made by evaporating the various components onto a\n        sapphire film using photoetched masks for dimensional\n        control.  The film, about 200 nm thick, is supported by a\n        sapphire disk.  The film was made by anodizing aluminum foil\n        and etching away the aluminum.  The black circular dots in\n        the figure are the sensitive areas overlaid with bismuth\n        oxide smoke which has good ir absorptivity but low thermal\n        mass.

At\n        other times the detector packages were backfilled with xenon\n        to protect the detectors while still allowing gross\n        sensitivity checks.  To avoid exposure to moisture during the\n        long period prior to launch when the IRTM was mounted on the\n        spacecraft and could not be sealed, the manifold was kept at\n        a slight positive pressure by a continuous flow of high\n        purity nitrogen.  The manifold was opened to space by launch\n        vehicle separation.\n \n \n      Sensitivity\n      -----------\n        The detectivity is 2.E8 CM_HZ**0.5_W**-1\n \n \n    Instrument Electronics 'IRTM'\n    =============================\n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The signal channels use a synchronous demodulation scheme to\n        provide good stability and to avoid 1/f noise in the preamp.\n        The input FET chopper is a full-wave type operating at 471\n        Hz.  This and the center-tapped thermopile allow voltage\n        doubling of the detector signal and noise and thus reduce the\n        preamp noise contribution which otherwise would be\n        significant.  The differential input connection, while\n        suffering a square root (2) noise disadvantage compared to\n        single-ended input, provides excellent common mode rejection\n        of chopper spikes and other input noise.  Temperature\n        dependence of the thermopile, about -0.5%/degree C., is\n        compensated by a thermister network external to the hybrid\n        package.  Preamp gain is adjustable with an external\n        resistor.  Following the half-wave synchronous demodulator is\n        an integrate, hold, and reset circuit with an integrate time\n        of 981 msec.  The integrator serves as a low pass filter\n        while the hold feature ensures spatial simultaneity of\n        corresponding detectors in each telescope.  After completion\n        of sampling by the multiplexer, all channel hold circuits are\n        reset to ensure independence of data samples.  The IRTM\n        analog signals, which have a range of +/- 6V, are digitized\n        by the analog-to-pulse width converter and flight data\n        subsystem (FDS) counter into +/- 2**9 levels, yielding 1023\n        data numbers (DN) which are nearly linear with radiance in\n        each channel.  The IRTM multiplexer consists of sixty-eight\n        FET switches and a buffer signal amplifier.  In addition to\n        thirty-two data channels (twenty-eight active and four\n        spare), thirty-two channels of engineering data are also\n        sample.  These include eight temperature measurements from\n        thermisters located at four locations on the reference plate,\n        the electronics module, and each of the three ir detector\n        packages (telescopes A, B, C).  Three power supply voltages\n        and the pre-dc restore voltage of twenty-one channels\n        (telescopes A, B, and C) are monitored.  The pre-dc restore\n        monitors are diagnostic to determine the presence of large\n        thermal or detector offsets.  The scan mirror is driven by a\n        four-position stepper motor through a 50/1 gear reduction.  A\n        motor drive pulse duration of 40 msec allows a 90 degree\n        mirror rotation in 2 sec.  The mirror position is sensed by a\n        two-bit encoder on the motor shaft; the contacts at the three\n        desired positions are about half of the width of 1.8 degree\n        mirror step.  The motor stepping is controlled by the FDS\n        using a comparison of the encoder readout with the desired\n        position originating either from the FDS normal mode clock or\n        direct ground command; the motor cannot be directly\n        commanded.  In addition to the restore which occurs\n        automatically in the normal model when the mirror reaches the\n        space position, restores can be ground commanded when the\n        IRTM is in the fixed planet or fixed space mode; in either\n        case housekeeping data are multiplexed into the data stream\n        during the 1-sec restore period.  Whenever the mirror reaches\n        the reference position, the calibration lamp is turned on for\n        the next two integration periods.  The lamp is at full\n        radiance throughout the second integration period, which is\n        used for gain determination of the D telescope channels.  In\n        the fixed reference mode, science and housekeeping data are\n        sampled alternatively.\n \n \n    Instrument Filter 'A - T20'\n    ===========================\n      Filter Name                    : T20\n      Filter Type                    : RESTSTRAHLEN\n      Minimum Wavelength             : 17.700000\n      Maximum Wavelength             : 30.000000\n      Center Filter Wavelength       : 21.000000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        Relative spectral response of all channels was measured end\n        to end using a Perkin-Elmer 16 U monochrometer with\n        appropriate gratings and order filters.  A globar at 1400 K\n        was used in the 2-25 micrometer range; shortward of 2.0\n        micrometers a tungsten source at 2700 K was used.  The\n        reference detector was a thermocouple for all but the 0.4-1.1\n        micrometer range, where a calibrated silicon photodiode was\n        used.  Out-of-band measurements were made by replacing the\n        spectrometer grating with a plane mirror and ir materials\n        having known cutoff and cuton wavelengths.  Flux calibration\n        of the IRTM was performed under a simulated space environment\n        using a vacuum chamber operated typically at a pressure of\n        1.E-6 Torr.  The IRTM was operated by means of a console\n        which simulated the interfaces and functions of the\n        spacecraft FDS.  A minicomputer was used to provide all\n        operational sequences and modes.  Data were recorded on\n        magnetic tape for subsequent computer processing.  The\n        calibration fixture consisted of two identical blackbodies,\n        one located in front of the space port and maintained at\n        liquid nitrogen temperature and the other in front of the\n        plant port and adjustable in temperature from 77 K to 350K;\n        eleven settings from 140 K to 330 K were used.  Blackbody\n        temperatures were measured with platinum resistance\n        thermometers having an absolute accuracy of +/- 0.1 degrees\n        C.  traceable to the National Bureau of Standards.  The\n        digitizer used in the test console provided ten times the\n        resolution of the FDS digitizer, thus making the digitizing\n        uncertainty during calibration insignificant compared to the\n        noise.  The calibration data thus produced are IRTM output in\n        digitization level (DN) as a function of blackbody\n        temperature.  Radiometrically measured internal reference\n        surface temperatures showed close agreement (+/- 0.5 degrees\n        C.) with those measured independently with a thermister.  The\n        IRTM temperature was controlled by regulating the temperature\n        of a mounting base plate and the thermal shield inside the\n        vacuum chamber.  Calibration was performed at 10 degrees C.\n        spacing across the range of operating temperatures expected\n        during flight.  Typical IRTM channel response to scene\n        brightness temperatures is shown in Fig.  8 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The one-sample noise on the thermal\n        channels is less than 1 DN except for the 15 micrometer\n        channel where it is about 2.5 DN.

The\n        digitizer used in the test console provided ten times the\n        resolution of the FDS digitizer, thus making the digitizing\n        uncertainty during calibration insignificant compared to the\n        noise.  The calibration data thus produced are IRTM output in\n        digitization level (DN) as a function of blackbody\n        temperature.

It is an f/3.5, 20.3-cm focal\n        length Cassegrainian design with an aperture diameter of\n        5.8-cm., spherical surfaces, and, except for mirror\n        materials, is identical to the B and C telescopes.  By using\n        relatively slow fore optics, degradation of filter sharpness\n        normally caused by operating an interference filter in a low\n        f-number beam is negligible.  The focal plane contains a\n        field-defining aperture plate with seven 0.107-cm diameter\n        holes arranged in a chevron pattern.  The fields of view thus\n        defined are nested with those of the MAWD and imaging systems\n        (Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978).  Behind each hole in the field\n        stop plate is a lens which produces a 0.0254-cm diam image of\n        the telescope aperture on the detector, which itself is about\n        the same size.  The final optical speed at the detector is\n        f/1.  Optical materials used in the four telescopes are shown\n        in Table II, and the resulting spectral response is shown in\n        Fig.  5 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  Mirrors are made of hot-pressed\n        uncoated zinc oxide for both primary and secondary mirrors.\n        The reststrahlen reflection properties of ZnO are the major\n        factors in the A telescope spectral response.  Minimizing\n        extrafield sensitivity (EFS) was an important aspect of the\n        optical design since on previous Mariner radiometers EFS\n        contribution seriously compromised observations of scenes\n        near large temperature contrasts (points near the planetary\n        limb and polar caps).  During instrumentation development,\n        IRTM image quality was determined in two angular regions.  In\n        the near-field region, a laboratory collimator and ir source\n        were used to measure the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad\n        diam (three fields of view).  Point source field of view\n        measurements in this region are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far field measurements, sensitivity\n        constraints dictated an approach in which the fraction of\n        energy within a given angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm\n        diam, concentric grooved, blackbody plate with a series of\n        restricting apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm,\n        140-cm, and 610-cm) to define angular response regions from\n        about one field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the\n        telescope focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at\n        that distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2\n        mrad).  The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a\n        heater/regulator and integral water jacket.  To prevent\n        difficulties with atmospheric transmission, the entire\n        apparatus was contained in a polyethylene bag flushed with\n        dry N2.  The EFS problem was more severe for the longer\n        wavelength A telescope than the others, possibly owing to the\n        higher reflectance at longer wavelengths of the black paint\n        used inside the telescope.  Tests using this apparatus led to\n        several telescope modifications designed to reduce EFS (see\n        Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal baffle was\n        placed between the field lens and the detectors to confine\n        energy to the sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A spider\n        baffle, added to the outer edges of the secondary mirror\n        support spider, was designed to reduce reflection off the\n        sides of the spider legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with CTL\n        15 black paint was placed on the central dead spot of the\n        secondary mirror.  This was designed to prevent focal plane\n        reflections from falling on the detectors.  Of these three\n        modifications, only the cone baffle gave significant\n        improvement, although all three were incorporated in the\n        design.  These results of the final EFS measurements are\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response\n        due to diffraction and the measured values are shown.  The\n        integrated EFS response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was\n        about 4%.  Of this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.\n        The effect of response outside of the nominal field of view\n        can be estimated directly from data obtained on scans across\n        the hot (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the\n        response is circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates\n        this to be closely followed, the signature of a half space\n        would also be symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived\n        from a Viking 1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was\n        determined using a 20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate\n        all four telescopes with a small source of high temperature\n        blackbody radiation.  Measurements were taken simultaneously\n        in twenty-eight channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.\n        For each channel, a parabolic ellipsoid was fit to data where\n        the measured intensity was more than 10% of the peak\n        intensity in that channel.  The alignment of each telescope\n        was ascertained by combining the center of response so\n        determined for the seven channels in the telescope.  This\n        procedure allowed for the alignment of the four telescopes to\n        be determined with an estimated precision of 0.1 mrad.  The\n        back of the secondary mirror of the B telescope was\n        aluminized and used as the alignment reference for this\n        procedure and for instrument alignment on the spacecraft.\n        The instrument pointing direction was verified in the same\n        manner just prior to planetary encounter using Mars as a\n        5-mrad diam source and using the science platform motion to\n        generate a 5-mrad spaced grid.  The in-flight alignment is\n        shown in Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n \n \n    Instrument Optics 'B'\n    =====================\n      Telescope Diameter             : 0.058000\n      Telescope F Number             : 3.500000\n      Telescope Focal Length         : 0.203000\n      Telescope Resolution           : 0.005100\n      Telescope T Number             : UNK\n      Telescope Transmittance        : UNK\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The A telescope (17.7-24 micrometer) is shown schematically\n        in Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.

The\n        out-of-band response for the B telescope is less than 0.1% of\n        full scale for an object of 1.E-6 the radiance of a 5800-K\n        blackbody, the level expected for reflectance from the\n        subsolar region of Mars.  Minimizing extrafield sensitivity\n        (EFS) was an important aspect of the optical design since on\n        previous Mariner radiometers EFS contribution seriously\n        compromised observations of scenes near large temperature\n        contrasts (points near the planetary limb and polar caps).\n        During instrumentation development, IRTM image quality was\n        determined in two angular regions.  In the near-field region,\n        a laboratory collimator and ir source were used to measure\n        the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad diam (three fields of\n        view).  Point source field of view measurements in this\n        region are shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far\n        field measurements, sensitivity constraints dictated an\n        approach in which the fraction of energy within a given\n        angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm diam, concentric\n        grooved, blackbody plate with a series of restricting\n        apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm, 140-cm, and\n        610-cm) to define angular response regions from about one\n        field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the telescope\n        focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at that\n        distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2 mrad).\n        The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a heater/regulator\n        and integral water jacket.  To prevent difficulties with\n        atmospheric transmission, the entire apparatus was contained\n        in a polyethylene bag flushed with dry N2.  Tests using this\n        apparatus led to several telescope modifications designed to\n        reduce EFS (see Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal\n        baffle was placed between the field lens and the detectors to\n        confine energy to the sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A\n        spider baffle, added to the outer edges of the secondary\n        mirror support spider, was designed to reduce reflection off\n        the sides of the spider legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with\n        CTL 15 black paint was placed on the central dead spot of the\n        secondary mirror.  This was designed to prevent focal plane\n        reflections from falling on the detectors.  Of these three\n        modifications, only the cone baffle gave significant\n        improvement, although all three were incorporated in the\n        design.  These results of the final EFS measurements are\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response\n        due to diffraction and the measured values are shown.  The\n        integrated EFS response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was\n        about 4%.  Of this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.\n        The effect of response outside of the nominal field of view\n        can be estimated directly from data obtained on scans across\n        the hot (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the\n        response is circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates\n        this to be closely followed, the signature of a half space\n        would also be symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived\n        from a Viking 1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was\n        determined using a 20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate\n        all four telescopes with a small source of high temperature\n        blackbody radiation.  Measurements were taken simultaneously\n        in twenty-eight channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.\n        For each channel, a parabolic ellipsoid was fit to data where\n        the measured intensity was more than 10% of the peak\n        intensity in that channel.  The alignment of each telescope\n        was ascertained by combining the center of response so\n        determined for the seven channels in the telescope.  This\n        procedure allowed by the alignment of the four telescopes to\n        be determined with an estimated precision of 0.1 mrad.  The\n        back of the secondary mirror of the B telescope was\n        aluminized and used as the alignment reference for this\n        procedure and for instrument alignment on the spacecraft.\n        The instrument pointing direction was verified in the same\n        manner just prior to planetary encounter using Mars as a\n        5-mrad diam source and using the science platform motion to\n        generate a 5-mrad spaced grid.  The in-flight alignment is\n        shown in Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n \n \n    Instrument Optics 'C'\n    =====================\n      Telescope Diameter             : 0.058000\n      Telescope F Number             : 3.500000\n      Telescope Focal Length         : 0.203000\n      Telescope Resolution           : 0.005100\n      Telescope T Number             : UNK\n      Telescope Transmittance        : UNK\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The A telescope (17.7-24 micrometer) is shown schematically\n        in Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  It is an f/3.5, 20.3-cm focal\n        length Cassegrainian design with an aperture diameter of\n        5.8-cm., spherical surfaces, and, except for mirror\n        materials, is identical to the B and C telescopes.  The focal\n        plane contains a field-defining aperture plate with seven\n        0.107-cm diameter holes arranged in a chevron pattern.  The\n        fields of view thus defined are nested with those of the MAWD\n        and imaging systems (Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978).  Behind\n        each hole in the field stop plate is a lens which produces a\n        0.0254-cm diam image of the telescope aperture on the\n        detector, which itself is about the same size.  The final\n        optical speed at the detector is f/1.  Optical materials used\n        in the four telescopes are shown in Table II, and the\n        resulting spectral response is shown in Fig.  5 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  Mirrors are made of aluminized and SiO\n        overcoated fused silica except for the A telescope, which\n        uses hot-pressed uncoated zinc oxide for both primary and\n        secondary mirrors.  The spectral bandpass of the other ir\n        channels is determined by interference bandpass filters and\n        AR coated detector lenses.  The out-of-band response for the\n        B and C telescopes is less than 0.1% of full scale for an\n        object of 1.E-6 the radiance of a 5800-K blackbody, the level\n        expected for reflectance from the subsolar region of Mars.\n        The A band has less than 0.1% response for wavelengths less\n        than 16 micrometer, and wavelengths longer than 30 micrometer\n        are limited by the Irtran 6 field lens.  Minimizing\n        extrafield sensitivity (EFS) was an important aspect of the\n        optical design since on previous Mariner radiometers EFS\n        contribution seriously compromised observations of scenes\n        near large temperature contrasts (points near the planetary\n        limb and polar caps).  During instrumentation development,\n        IRTM image quality was determined in two angular regions.  In\n        the near-field region, a laboratory collimator and ir source\n        were used to measure the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad\n        diam (three fields of view).  Point source field of view\n        measurements in this region are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far field measurements, sensitivity\n        constraints dictated an approach in which the fraction of\n        energy within a given angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm\n        diam, concentric grooved, blackbody plate with a series of\n        restricting apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm,\n        140-cm, and 610-cm) to define angular response regions from\n        about one field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the\n        telescope focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at\n        that distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2\n        mrad).  The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a\n        heater/regulator and integral water jacket.  To prevent\n        difficulties with atmospheric transmission, the entire\n        apparatus was contained in a polyethylene bag flushed with\n        dry N2.  Tests using this apparatus led to several telescope\n        modifications designed to reduce EFS (see Fig.  3 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal baffle was placed between\n        the field lens and the detectors to confine energy to the\n        sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A spider baffle, added\n        to the outer edges of the secondary mirror support spider,\n        was designed to reduce reflection off the sides of the spider\n        legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with CTL 15 black paint was\n        placed on the central dead spot of the secondary mirror.\n        This was designed to prevent focal plane reflections from\n        falling on the detectors.  Of these three modifications, only\n        the cone baffle gave significant improvement, although all\n        three were incorporated in the design.  These results of the\n        final EFS measurements are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response due to diffraction\n        and the measured values are shown.  The integrated EFS\n        response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was about 4%.  Of\n        this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.  The effect of\n        response outside of the nominal field of view can be\n        estimated directly from data obtained on scans across the hot\n        (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the response is\n        circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates this to be\n        closely followed, the signature of a half space would also be\n        symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived from a Viking\n        1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is shown in Fig.\n        6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was determined using a\n        20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate all four telescopes\n        with a small source of high temperature blackbody radiation.\n        Measurements were taken simultaneously in twenty-eight\n        channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.

The back\n        of the secondary mirror of the B telescope was aluminized and\n        used as the alignment reference for this procedure and for\n        instrument alignment on the spacecraft.  The instrument\n        pointing direction was verified in the same manner just prior\n        to planetary encounter using Mars as a 5-mrad diam source and\n        using the science platform motion to generate a 5-mrad spaced\n        grid.  The in-flight alignment is shown in Fig.  4 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n \n \n    Instrument Optics 'D'\n    =====================\n      Telescope Diameter             : 0.037000\n      Telescope F Number             : 5.500000\n      Telescope Focal Length         : 0.203000\n      Telescope Resolution           : UNK\n      Telescope T Number             : UNK\n      Telescope Transmittance        : UNK\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The D telescope has a reduced aperture of 3.7 cm and a focal\n        length of f/5.5.  By using relatively slow fore optics,\n        degradation of filter sharpness normally caused by operating\n        an interference filter in a low f-number beam is negligible.\n        The focal plane contains a field-defining aperture plate with\n        seven 0.107-cm diam holes arranged in a chevron pattern.  The\n        fields of view thus defined are nested with those of the MAWD\n        and imaging systems (Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978).  Behind\n        each hole in the field stop plate is a lens which produces a\n        0.0254-cm diam image of the telescope aperture on the\n        detector, which itself is about the same size.  The final\n        optical speed at the detector is f/1.  Optical materials used\n        in the four telescopes are shown in Table II, and the\n        resulting spectral response is shown in Fig.  5 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  Mirrors are made of aluminized and SiO\n        overcoated fused silica except for the A telescope, which\n        uses hot-pressed uncoated zinc oxide for both primary and\n        secondary mirrors.  The spectral bandpass of the other ir\n        channels is determined by interference bandpass filters and\n        AR coated detector lenses.  The transmission elements of the\n        D telescope insure that it is thermally blind.  Special\n        coatings on the D telescope mirrors were used to obtain a\n        reasonably gray response to solar radiation.  Minimizing\n        extrafield sensitivity (EFS) was an important aspect of the\n        optical design since on previous Mariner radiometers EFS\n        contribution seriously compromised observations of scenes\n        near large temperature contrasts (points near the planetary\n        limb and polar caps).  During instrumentation development,\n        IRTM image quality was determined in two angular regions.  In\n        the near-field region, a laboratory collimator and ir source\n        were used to measure the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad\n        diam (three fields of view).  Point source field of view\n        measurements in this region are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far field measurements, sensitivity\n        constraints dictated an approach in which the fraction of\n        energy within a given angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm\n        diam, concentric grooved, blackbody plate with a series of\n        restricting apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm,\n        140-cm, and 610-cm) to define angular response regions from\n        about one field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the\n        telescope focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at\n        that distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2\n        mrad).  The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a\n        heater/regulator and integral water jacket.  To prevent\n        difficulties with atmospheric transmission, the entire\n        apparatus was contained in a polyethylene bag flushed with\n        dry N2.  The EFS problem was more severe for the longer\n        wavelength A telescope than the others, possibly owing to the\n        higher reflectance at longer wavelengths of the black paint\n        used inside the telescope.  Tests using this apparatus led to\n        several telescope modifications designed to reduce EFS (see\n        Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal baffle was\n        placed between the field lens and the detectors to confine\n        energy to the sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A spider\n        baffle, added to the outer edges of the secondary mirror\n        support spider, was designed to reduce reflection off the\n        sides of the spider legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with CTL\n        15 black paint was placed on the central dead spot of the\n        secondary mirror.  This was designed to prevent focal plane\n        reflections from falling on the detectors.  Of these three\n        modifications, only the cone baffle gave significant\n        improvement, although all three were incorporated in the\n        design.  These results of the final EFS measurements are\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response\n        due to diffraction and the measured values are shown.  The\n        integrated EFS response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was\n        about 4%.  Of this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.\n        The effect of response outside of the nominal field of view\n        can be estimated directly from data obtained on scans across\n        the hot (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the\n        response is circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates\n        this to be closely followed, the signature of a half space\n        would also be symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived\n        from a Viking 1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was\n        determined using a 20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate\n        all four telescopes with a small source of high temperature\n        blackbody radiation.  Measurements were taken simultaneously\n        in twenty-eight channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.\n        For each channel, a parabolic ellipsoid was fit to data where\n        the measured intensity was more than 10% of the peak\n        intensity in that channel.  The alignment of each telescope\n        was ascertained by combining the center of response so\n        determined for the seven channels in the telescope.  This\n        procedure allowed by the alignment of the four telescopes to\n        be determined with an estimated precision of 0.1 mrad.  The\n        instrument pointing direction was verified in the same manner\n        just prior to planetary encounter using Mars as a 5-mrad diam\n        source and using the science platform motion to generate a\n        5-mrad spaced grid.

The REFERENCE position was\n        also the 'safe' position, used when the instrument was turned\n        off.\n \n        A MODIFIED normal mode was also available, in which the only\n        space view was the first of the cycle, followed by 243 ICKs\n        of planet data.  In NORMAL mode, ICKs 1 and 2 were\n        housekeeping data while the mirror moved to space.  ICK 3 was\n        the space level before reset.  During ICK 4, the electronics\n        for all channels were reset so that the sensed radiance\n        (meant to be the cosmic background level of essentially zero\n        radiance) yielded a data number (DN) of a few.  There was a\n        filter on the reset so that the voltage change was only about\n        2/3 of the way to the space radiance level; this smoothed out\n        the zero setting, but also meant that several cycles were\n        required to recover from a serious drift.  ICK 5 was still in\n        the space position and yielded the DN response to space.  Ick\n        6 and 7 were housekeeping data while the mirror moved to the\n        reference position.  ICK 8 and 9 were the DN response to the\n        reference surface; only the second reading was used in\n        calibration of the solar channel to allow the lamp filament\n        to warm up completely.  ICKs 10 through 13 were housekeeping\n        data while the mirror moved to the planet position.  The 57\n        ICKs 14-64 were planet data.  The 7 ICK cycle to space, with\n        reset of the zero-radiance DN level in all channels, was\n        repeated each 64 ICKs, beginning on ICKs 65, 129, and 193,\n        with motion directly back to the planet position for another\n        57 ICKs of planet data.\n \n \n    Instrument Mode 'NORMAL'\n    ========================\n      Instrument Power Consumption : 6.000000\n \n \n      In sections\n      -----------\n        IRTM\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        Other than power on or power off, the only command options\n        for the IRTM controlled the motion of the scan mirror.  This\n        mirror could be commanded to 3 positions, separated by 90\n        degrees; PLANET, SPACE, and REFERENCE.  In the PLANET\n        position, data were acquired in all 28 channels.  In SPACE,\n        the zero-radiance level was reset to near the bottom of the\n        dynamic range.  In the REFERENCE position, gain calibration\n        data was obtained using both a grooved blackbody at ambient\n        instrument temperature and a small lamp and hemispherical\n        diffuser for the solar telescope.  The REFERENCE position was\n        also the 'safe' position, used when the instrument was turned\n        off.\n \n        The NORMAL mode sequenced the pointing to PLANET most of the\n        time, with pointing to SPACE at intervals of 64 ICKs, and to\n        REFERENCE at intervals of 256 ICKs.  ICK is a one syllable\n        acronym for 'incremental counter keeper' and represents 1.12\n        second duration, the basic time interval of IRTM operation.\n        It required 2 ICKs for the mirror to move 90 degrees and\n        settle; whenever the mirror was in motion the downlink data\n        contained housekeeping information about instrument status\n        and detector voltage levels.\n \n        In NORMAL mode, ICKs 1 and 2 were housekeeping data while the\n        mirror moved to space.  ICK 3 was the space level before\n        reset.  During ICK 4, the electronics for all channels were\n        reset so that the sensed radiance (meant to be the cosmic\n        background level of essentially zero radiance) yielded a data\n        number (DN) of a few.

ICKs 10 through 13 were housekeeping data while\n        the mirror moved to the planet position.  The 57 ICKs 14-64\n        were planet data.  The 7 ICK cycle to space, with reset of\n        the zero-radiance DN level in all channels, was repeated each\n        64 ICKs, beginning on ICKs 65, 129, and 193, with motion\n        directly back to the planet position for another 57 ICKs of\n        planet data.\n \n \n    Mounted On Platform 'SCAN PLATFORM'\n    ===================================\n      Cone Offset Angle              : 0.040000\n      Cross Cone Offset Angle        : -0.060000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        OFFSET ANGLE SCALED FROM FIGURE 4 OF CHASE_ETAL_1978; these\n        were determined by scans across Mars during approach, when\n        the angular diameter of the planet was 1.93 and 4.79\n        milliradians (VO-1)",

The VMIS\n      consists of three major assemblies:\n \n      1) The Meteorology Sensor Array (MSA), which supports\n      the wind and temperature sensors and provides a housing\n      for the low-level electronics.\n      2) The Meteorology Boom Assembly (MBA), which provides\n      the means for positioning the MSA after landing.\n      Following deployment of the MBA, the MSA is positioned\n      nominally 1.6 meters above the ground, 0.7 meter above\n      the top of the Lander body, and about 0.3 meter\n      horizontally outward from the closest portion of the\n      Lander body.\n      3) The Meteorology Electronic Assembly (MEA), which\n      provides power to the sensors and conditions the\n      signals from the sensors so that the proper interface\n      with the Lander electronic system is maintained.\n \n      The individual sensors are described below (see\n      CHAMBERLAIN_ETAL1976):\n \n      The ambient pressure sensor is located in the Lander body near\n      the MEA and has an external pressure line running to a port on\n      the bottom plate of the Lander body.  The sensor is a\n      stretched-diaphragm-type variable reluctance transducer that\n      operates over a range of 0 to 18 millibars.\n \n      The ambient temperature sensor consists of three\n      Chromel-Constantan thermocouples wired in parallel.  It is\n      capable of measuring over the entire range of expected martian\n      temperatures with an accuracy of about 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n \n      The reference temperature sensor was a platinum resistance\n      thermometer mounted between the wind speed elements (see\n      below).\n \n      Wind speed is measured by means of two hot film anemometers\n      oriented orthogonal to each other and lying in the horizontal\n      plane.  These hot film elements were maintained at a nominal\n      overheat temperature of 100 degrees Celsius above the air\n      temperature measured by the reference temperature sensor.  The\n      power required to maintain each anemometer at the specified\n      temperature was a function of the component of the wind speed\n      orthogonal to the element.\n \n      The wind speed sensors also measure wind direction, but with a\n      fourfold ambiguity.  Selection of the proper quadrant is\n      accomplished by a quadrant sensor, consisting of a heated\n      cylindrical platinum core (maintained at a 100 degrees Celsius\n      overheat) surrounded by four thermocouple junctions at equal\n      angles and distance from the core.  Thermocouples on opposite\n      sides of the post comprised a thermocouple pair which was\n      connected in series, allowing for measurement of the\n      temperature differences across each pair.  These differences\n      resulted from the thermal wake in the lee of the heated center\n      core.  The quadrant sensor values were functions, though not\n      single-valued, of wind speed.  The redundant wind speed and\n      directional information provided by both the wind speed and\n      quadrant sensors was combined using a least squares technique\n      to give the best estimates of wind speed and direction.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The scientific objectives of the Viking Meteorology Instrument\n      System (VMIS) are:\n \n      DETECTION OF MEDIUM- AND SMALL-SCALE SYSTEMS: The length scales\n      associated with convective processes (thermals, dust devils)\n      and mesoscale processes (fronts, small dust storms) are\n      considerably greater than the length scales that can be\n      measured by the Lander.  These atmospheric systems can be\n      detected and studied by the VMIS only when they pass the\n      Landers and then only if the VMIS is taking data at the time\n      the system passes.  It is an objective of the VMIS to measure\n      the passage of such systems and to study their structures.\n \n      MEASUREMENT OF SYNOPTIC- AND PLANETARY-SCALE SYSTEMS: With just\n      two observation points, it will not be possible to study the\n      structure of atmospheric systems on a planetary scale.  It will\n      be possible, however, to determine some parameters about the\n      general circulation that can provide useful constraints on\n      theory.  Examples are measurements of large-scale winds,\n      diurnal variations, and annual variations of atmospheric\n      conditions.\n \n      DETERMINATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYER:\n      An objective of the VMIS is to measure temperature, wind speed,\n      and wind direction in the turbulent boundary layer to\n      understand better the vertical transport of properties such as\n      momentum and heat throughout the diurnal cycle.\n \n      MEASUREMENT OF THE LOCAL ENVIORNMENT: It is an objective to\n      determine the meteorological environment in which the Landers\n      operate and how that environment varies diurnally, seasonally,\n      and annually.\n \n      SUPPORT OF OTHER EXPERIMENTS: Measurements made by VMIS may aid\n      in the analysis of data obtained by other Lander experiments.\n      For example, wind gusts can shake the Lander and cause spurious\n      signals to be generated by the seismometer.  Measurements of\n      wind speed and direction may aid in analyzing images of clouds\n      (dust and condensate), and temperature data will aid in\n      interpretation of observations of condensates.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Problems with the ambient temperature sensor on Lander 2 were\n      noted shortly before launch.  The readings exhibited a\n      temperature-dependent error, increasing as Lander body\n      temperature decreased.  The error gradually decreased after\n      power-up of the electronics, approaching a steady-state value\n      after 30-40 minutes of operation.  Analysis of the landed data\n      and comparison with the reference temperature sensors on both\n      Landers and the ambient temperature sensor on Lander 1\n      permitted a suitable correction to be applied.  This required\n      that power be left on continuously to eliminate drift.  This\n      was done from Lander 2 sol 25 onward.  The corrections to the\n      Lander 2 ambient temperature sensor limit its accuracy to about\n      3 degrees Celsius (see HESS_ETAL_1977).\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The Viking Meteorology Instrument System (VMIS), including\n      software, was subjected to an extensive test program at the\n      Langley Research Center.  The instrument was tested over the\n      anticipated range of Martian wind speeds (directions 0 to 360\n      degrees) and at temperatures as low as 200 degrees Kelvin.  The\n      data from these tests were reduced using the flight software,\n      and the results were compared to facility parameters that were\n      reduced independently.  These tests indicate that the VMIS\n      (including software, but not accounting for Lander flow-field\n      effects) has an accuracy of about 10% in wind speed, 10% in\n      wind direction, and 1.5 degree Kelvin in temperature.\n \n      The pressure transducers were calibrated to approximately 0.01\n      to 0.02 millibars accuracy over the ranges expected for martian\n      atmospheric pressure variation.  Calibrations to accuracies\n      greater than allowed by the digitizing system were accomplished\n      by test support instrumentation.  Repeatability from year to\n      year of the daily average pressures indicates that the\n      transducers have remained stable to significantly better than\n      0.04 millibars throughout the mission, possibly maintaining\n      stabilities on the order of 0.01 millibars.\n \n      It should be noted that the Meteorology Boom Assembly was\n      positioned on the Lander to minimize the effects of the\n      Lander-induced flow field.  The Lander effect is about 10% in\n      wind direction and 10% in wind speed and is a function of wind\n      direction and possibly local terrain.  Turbulence and other\n      effects will further contribute to instrument error.

Under ground command, the sampling rate, duration\n        over which a given sampling rate is maintained, the serial\n        sequence of sampling rates and duration, the time between\n        sampling sequences, the times and frequencies of sampling\n        initiation, and the total amount of data taken per martian\n        day (sol) can be varied.  Prior to landing, preplanned\n        sequences were loaded into each Lander.  These consisted of\n        modules with durations of of about 9, 20, and 39 minutes\n        spaced nominally 1.5 hours apart throughout the sol.\n        Intervals between individual samples were 4 and 8 seconds for\n        the 9 minute modules, 4 seconds for the 39 minute modules,\n        and 2 seconds for the 20 minute modules.  One complete\n        sequence consisted of 18 modules.  Sixteen of these were 9\n        minutes long and two, spaced about 12 hours apart, were of\n        longer duration (one being 39 minutes long, the other 20\n        minutes long).  The 18 periods were spaced so as to occupy\n        somewhat more than a sol.  As a result, the pattern of\n        sequences stepped ahead about 1.5 hours each sol.  This\n        survey mode was adopted in order to define the diurnal cycle\n        while moving long sequences through the sol, thus permitting\n        a study of fluctuation characteristics at all portions of the\n        diurnal cycle.\n \n        Later in the mission, extended periods of rapid sampling\n        (about 1 second intervals) were included to study boundary\n        layer characteristics at as high a sampling rate as the\n        system would allow.  In addition, various alterations were\n        made in sampling rates, durations, and measurement periods to\n        determine an optimal pattern for sampling the martian\n        atmosphere.  It became evident that the total science return\n        would be maximized by taking samples nearly continuously but\n        at rates slow enough to satisfy mission constraints on total\n        meteorology data.

	"display_description": "Instrument Overview\n    ===================\n      The Viking Lander camera design was very different from vidicon\n      framing or CCD array cameras.  The lander camera was a\n      facsimile camera with a single, stationary photosensor array\n      (PSA) and azimuth and elevation scanning mechanisms.  A lander\n      image was generated by scanning the scene in two directions\n      (azimuth and elevation) to focus light onto the photosensor\n      array.  A number of published papers described the\n      characteristics and performance of the lander cameras.  The\n      scientific rational and early design of the cameras were\n      described in Mutch et al.  [1972] and a detailed description of\n      the flight cameras was given in Huck et al. [1975b].  Huck and\n      Wall [1976] discussed image quality and Patterson et al.\n      [1977] described camera performance during the Primary Mission.\n      A summary of the information from these papers is given here as\n      a high-level description of the camera and its operating modes.\n \n \n    Platform Mounting Descriptions\n    ==============================\n      Each camera was bolted to the top of the lander body.  The\n      camera had a lower stationary section containing electronics\n      and an upper section that rotated in azimuth (i.e., around a\n      vertical axis).  The other prominent exterior component was a\n      post assembly that protected the camera window from the Mars\n      environment when the camera was not in use.  At the top of the\n      post was a carbon dioxide dust removal nozzle.  Major internal\n      camera components were two fused silica windows, a mirror,\n      elevation and azimuth rotation assemblies, a lens, the\n      photosensor array, electronics, and pinlights for calibration.\n      The overall camera height was 55.6 cm.  The lower assembly\n      diameter was 25.6 cm and the upper assembly diameter was 14.4\n      cm.  The weight of the camera was 7.26 kg.  Below is a table\n      that lists the serial number of the cameras and photosensor\n      arrays as they were assigned to the flight cameras [Huck et\n      al., 1975a].\n \n      Camera                  Serial Number  PSA Serial Number\n      --------------------------------------------------------\n      Viking 1, camera 1      FC-1B               M017\n \n      Viking 1, camera 2      FC-2A               M020\n \n      Viking 2, camera 1      FC-3A               M015\n \n      Viking 2, camera 2      SPARE               M019\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      The camera had several features to deal with possible dust\n      abrasion or obscuration.  When the camera was not in use, the\n      upper assembly was rotated so that the window was behind the\n      post assembly to prevent exposure to dust.  Mounted in the post\n      was a nozzle for releasing carbon dioxide gas to blow dust off\n      the window.  In addition, the outer window, known as the\n      contamination cover, was designed to move out of the optical\n      path if it became abraded or dust coated.  The contamination\n      cover window was hinged and spring loaded so that it could be\n      deployed by rotating the camera behind the post with enough\n      force to release the spring lever.  During the Extended Mission\n      the contamination cover windows of camera 1 on lander 1 and\n      camera 2 on lander 2 were deployed.  One drawback of the\n      contamination cover window was that its frame caused a\n      vignetting effect at elevation angles above 25 deg.  [Patterson\n      et al., 1977].\n \n      Light entered the camera through the windows, reflected off the\n      mirror toward the lens, passed through the lens, and was sensed\n      by one of the photodiodes.  A voltage was generated in the\n      selected photodiode that was digitized by an analog-to-digital\n      (A/D) converter.  Below the lens was a black shutter that could\n      be closed to sample photodiode dark current and to perform\n      internal radiometric calibration.  Between the lens and\n      photosensor array was a light baffle to minimize internal\n      reflections.  The lens had a 0.95 cm aperture diameter and 5.37\n      cm focal length.\n \n      Mechanical scanning was done by rotating the mirror around a\n      horizontal axis to scan each vertical line in an image.  The\n      entire upper camera assembly rotated around a vertical axis to\n      scan successive lines.  Image data were collected while the\n      mirror rotated up through the elevation range in 512 steps\n      (i.e., pixels were sampled from the bottom of the image to the\n      top).  The mirror rapidly rotated down to the start position\n      while the camera turned in azimuth for the next scan.  The\n      mirror could rotate from 60 deg below the horizon to 40 deg\n      above it for a total range of 100 deg.  The camera could see\n      342.5 deg in azimuth with the range limited by the post\n      assembly.  Image commands specified both a start and stop\n      azimuth such that the width of images varied.  On receiving a\n      command to acquire an image, the camera first rotated to a\n      preset azimuth and then rotated to the start azimuth.  The\n      camera stepped in azimuth after each vertical scan until the\n      stop azimuth was reached.  The sequence ended by the camera\n      moving back to the preset position and then to the park\n      position with the window behind the post.  The preset position\n      at the beginning and end of the sequence prevented the camera\n      from turning through mechanical stops.  Internal radiometric\n      calibration could be done by closing the shutter while the\n      camera was in the preset position either before or after the\n      image data were acquired.  The camera had two scanning rates so\n      that data could be collected at 250 or 16,000 bits/sec.\n \n      The photosensor array consisted of 12 silicon photodiodes (or\n      diodes) sensitive to light between 0.4 and 1.1 micrometers.\n      The diodes were arranged in a 2x6 array.  There were four broad\n      band, high resolution (0.04 deg angular resolution) diodes,\n      known as BB1, BB2, BB3, and BB4.  The distance between the lens\n      and each high resolution diode was different to vary the\n      in-focus distance of each diode.  In-focus distances were 1.9,\n      3.7, 4.5, and 13.3 meters for BB1, BB2, BB3, an BB4,\n      respectively.  There was a low resolution (0.12 deg angular\n      resolution), broad band diode known as the SURVEY diode.  There\n      were also six narrow band, low resolution diodes for color\n      (BLUE, GREEN, and RED) and infrared (IR1, IR2, and IR3) images.\n      The narrow bandwidth was generated by covering diodes with a\n      set of interference filters, chosen to survive the spacecraft\n      sterilization process.  The interference filters had\n      significant out-of-band leaks.  Also, the infrared filters were\n      known to degrade due to neutron radiation from the lander RTGs\n      [Patterson et al., 1977].  The twelfth diode was also a low\n      resolution diode covered by a red filter for imaging the Sun.\n      The in-focus distance for the low resolution diodes was about\n      3.7 meters.\n \n      Diodes in the camera generated a voltage proportional to\n      incoming radiance.  Each diode, except for the SUN diode, had\n      an amplifier to enhance the voltage signal.  The SUN diode did\n      not need an amplifier because of the strong signal when\n      directly viewing the Sun.  Voltage from the amplifier was\n      digitized as a 6-bit number in an A/D converter that also\n      performed automatic dark current subtraction.  Dark current was\n      sampled after every line in slow scan mode and after every 64th\n      line in rapid scan mode.  The A/D converter had 6 gains and 32\n      offsets so that the full dynamic range of the diode output\n      could be stored in 6-bits.  Gain defined the voltage range\n      sampled and its resolution.  Low gain (high gain number)\n      covered a wide range in voltage and had low voltage resolution.\n      The offset could be varied from a slightly negative voltage to\n      several volts in 32 small steps.  Digital values from the A/D\n      converter could be dumped to the spacecraft tape recorder or\n      transmitted to Earth or an orbiter in real-time (usually done\n      at beginning or end of a transmission link when the bit error\n      rate was relatively high).\n \n      Each camera had two pinlights in the post assembly.  Using a\n      special command, the lights turned on and an image was acquired\n      while viewing the pinlights.  This command, known as a scan\n      verification, monitored the mechanical scanning operation of\n      the camera.  A third pinlight with four different radiance\n      levels was located between the dark current shutter and the\n      photosensor array.  This pinlight was used with the shutter\n      closed for radiometric calibration of the camera.\n \n \n    Operation and Sampling Modes\n    ============================\n      Operation of Viking Lander cameras was versatile in that many\n      parameters for the image could be specified.  Commands to\n      acquire an image involved selecting the sampling mode, diode,\n      start and stop azimuths, center elevation, gain and offset,\n      scan rate, and specifying whether automatic dark current\n      subtraction, internal calibration, rescan, or dusting were\n      done.  Image start time and whether the image was transmitted\n      in real-time or sent to the tape recorder were also specified.\n \n      The camera had seven sampling modes: low resolution (0.12 deg)\n      stepping with three diodes (known as triplet mode); low\n      resolution stepping with one diode; high resolution (0.04 deg)\n      stepping with one diode; and four different calibration lamp\n      intensity levels.  In triplet mode, elevation scanning was\n      repeated three times with three different diodes at every\n      azimuth position.  An unusual sampling mode effect was an\n      elevation shift when the step size did not match the diode\n      resolution.  There was a -5.6 deg elevation shift when using a\n      low resolution diode with high resolution stepping and a +5.6\n      deg shift when using a high resolution diode with low\n      resolution stepping.  These non-nominal modes were mostly used\n      to generate high resolution color images or to better resolve\n      the solar disk.  For the triplet mode, the specified diode was\n      the first of the three diodes, e.g., BLUE diode for a color\n      image.  Start and stop azimuths had to be multiples of 2.5 deg.\n      Center elevation had to be a multiple of 10 deg.  The elevation\n      range was determined by the step size with a range of about 20\n      deg for high resolution and about 60 deg for low resolution\n      since there was always 512 steps in an elevation scan.

	"display_description": "Instrument Overview\n    ===================\n      The Viking Lander camera design was very different from vidicon\n      framing or CCD array cameras.  The lander camera was a\n      facsimile camera with a single, stationary photosensor array\n      (PSA) and azimuth and elevation scanning mechanisms.  A lander\n      image was generated by scanning the scene in two directions\n      (azimuth and elevation) to focus light onto the photosensor\n      array.  A number of published papers described the\n      characteristics and performance of the lander cameras.  The\n      scientific rational and early design of the cameras were\n      described in Mutch et al.  [1972] and a detailed description of\n      the flight cameras was given in Huck et al. [1975b].  Huck and\n      Wall [1976] discussed image quality and Patterson et al.\n      [1977] described camera performance during the Primary Mission.\n      A summary of the information from these papers is given here as\n      a high-level description of the camera and its operating modes.\n \n \n    Platform Mounting Descriptions\n    ==============================\n      Each camera was bolted to the top of the lander body.  The\n      camera had a lower stationary section containing electronics\n      and an upper section that rotated in azimuth (i.e., around a\n      vertical axis).  The other prominent exterior component was a\n      post assembly that protected the camera window from the Mars\n      environment when the camera was not in use.  At the top of the\n      post was a carbon dioxide dust removal nozzle.  Major internal\n      camera components were two fused silica windows, a mirror,\n      elevation and azimuth rotation assemblies, a lens, the\n      photosensor array, electronics, and pinlights for calibration.\n      The overall camera height was 55.6 cm.  The lower assembly\n      diameter was 25.6 cm and the upper assembly diameter was 14.4\n      cm.  The weight of the camera was 7.26 kg.  Below is a table\n      that lists the serial number of the cameras and photosensor\n      arrays as they were assigned to the flight cameras [Huck et\n      al., 1975a].\n \n      Camera                  Serial Number  PSA Serial Number\n      --------------------------------------------------------\n      Viking 1, camera 1      FC-1B               M017\n \n      Viking 1, camera 2      FC-2A               M020\n \n      Viking 2, camera 1      FC-3A               M015\n \n      Viking 2, camera 2      SPARE               M019\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      The camera had several features to deal with possible dust\n      abrasion or obscuration.  When the camera was not in use, the\n      upper assembly was rotated so that the window was behind the\n      post assembly to prevent exposure to dust.  Mounted in the post\n      was a nozzle for releasing carbon dioxide gas to blow dust off\n      the window.  In addition, the outer window, known as the\n      contamination cover, was designed to move out of the optical\n      path if it became abraded or dust coated.  The contamination\n      cover window was hinged and spring loaded so that it could be\n      deployed by rotating the camera behind the post with enough\n      force to release the spring lever.  During the Extended Mission\n      the contamination cover windows of camera 1 on lander 1 and\n      camera 2 on lander 2 were deployed.  One drawback of the\n      contamination cover window was that its frame caused a\n      vignetting effect at elevation angles above 25 deg.  [Patterson\n      et al., 1977].\n \n      Light entered the camera through the windows, reflected off the\n      mirror toward the lens, passed through the lens, and was sensed\n      by one of the photodiodes.  A voltage was generated in the\n      selected photodiode that was digitized by an analog-to-digital\n      (A/D) converter.  Below the lens was a black shutter that could\n      be closed to sample photodiode dark current and to perform\n      internal radiometric calibration.  Between the lens and\n      photosensor array was a light baffle to minimize internal\n      reflections.  The lens had a 0.95 cm aperture diameter and 5.37\n      cm focal length.\n \n      Mechanical scanning was done by rotating the mirror around a\n      horizontal axis to scan each vertical line in an image.  The\n      entire upper camera assembly rotated around a vertical axis to\n      scan successive lines.  Image data were collected while the\n      mirror rotated up through the elevation range in 512 steps\n      (i.e., pixels were sampled from the bottom of the image to the\n      top).  The mirror rapidly rotated down to the start position\n      while the camera turned in azimuth for the next scan.  The\n      mirror could rotate from 60 deg below the horizon to 40 deg\n      above it for a total range of 100 deg.  The camera could see\n      342.5 deg in azimuth with the range limited by the post\n      assembly.  Image commands specified both a start and stop\n      azimuth such that the width of images varied.  On receiving a\n      command to acquire an image, the camera first rotated to a\n      preset azimuth and then rotated to the start azimuth.  The\n      camera stepped in azimuth after each vertical scan until the\n      stop azimuth was reached.  The sequence ended by the camera\n      moving back to the preset position and then to the park\n      position with the window behind the post.  The preset position\n      at the beginning and end of the sequence prevented the camera\n      from turning through mechanical stops.  Internal radiometric\n      calibration could be done by closing the shutter while the\n      camera was in the preset position either before or after the\n      image data were acquired.  The camera had two scanning rates so\n      that data could be collected at 250 or 16,000 bits/sec.\n \n      The photosensor array consisted of 12 silicon photodiodes (or\n      diodes) sensitive to light between 0.4 and 1.1 micrometers.\n      The diodes were arranged in a 2x6 array.  There were four broad\n      band, high resolution (0.04 deg angular resolution) diodes,\n      known as BB1, BB2, BB3, and BB4.  The distance between the lens\n      and each high resolution diode was different to vary the\n      in-focus distance of each diode.  In-focus distances were 1.9,\n      3.7, 4.5, and 13.3 meters for BB1, BB2, BB3, an BB4,\n      respectively.  There was a low resolution (0.12 deg angular\n      resolution), broad band diode known as the SURVEY diode.  There\n      were also six narrow band, low resolution diodes for color\n      (BLUE, GREEN, and RED) and infrared (IR1, IR2, and IR3) images.\n      The narrow bandwidth was generated by covering diodes with a\n      set of interference filters, chosen to survive the spacecraft\n      sterilization process.  The interference filters had\n      significant out-of-band leaks.  Also, the infrared filters were\n      known to degrade due to neutron radiation from the lander RTGs\n      [Patterson et al., 1977].  The twelfth diode was also a low\n      resolution diode covered by a red filter for imaging the Sun.\n      The in-focus distance for the low resolution diodes was about\n      3.7 meters.\n \n      Diodes in the camera generated a voltage proportional to\n      incoming radiance.  Each diode, except for the SUN diode, had\n      an amplifier to enhance the voltage signal.  The SUN diode did\n      not need an amplifier because of the strong signal when\n      directly viewing the Sun.  Voltage from the amplifier was\n      digitized as a 6-bit number in an A/D converter that also\n      performed automatic dark current subtraction.  Dark current was\n      sampled after every line in slow scan mode and after every 64th\n      line in rapid scan mode.  The A/D converter had 6 gains and 32\n      offsets so that the full dynamic range of the diode output\n      could be stored in 6-bits.  Gain defined the voltage range\n      sampled and its resolution.  Low gain (high gain number)\n      covered a wide range in voltage and had low voltage resolution.\n      The offset could be varied from a slightly negative voltage to\n      several volts in 32 small steps.  Digital values from the A/D\n      converter could be dumped to the spacecraft tape recorder or\n      transmitted to Earth or an orbiter in real-time (usually done\n      at beginning or end of a transmission link when the bit error\n      rate was relatively high).\n \n      Each camera had two pinlights in the post assembly.  Using a\n      special command, the lights turned on and an image was acquired\n      while viewing the pinlights.  This command, known as a scan\n      verification, monitored the mechanical scanning operation of\n      the camera.  A third pinlight with four different radiance\n      levels was located between the dark current shutter and the\n      photosensor array.  This pinlight was used with the shutter\n      closed for radiometric calibration of the camera.\n \n \n    Operation and Sampling Modes\n    ============================\n      Operation of Viking Lander cameras was versatile in that many\n      parameters for the image could be specified.  Commands to\n      acquire an image involved selecting the sampling mode, diode,\n      start and stop azimuths, center elevation, gain and offset,\n      scan rate, and specifying whether automatic dark current\n      subtraction, internal calibration, rescan, or dusting were\n      done.  Image start time and whether the image was transmitted\n      in real-time or sent to the tape recorder were also specified.\n \n      The camera had seven sampling modes: low resolution (0.12 deg)\n      stepping with three diodes (known as triplet mode); low\n      resolution stepping with one diode; high resolution (0.04 deg)\n      stepping with one diode; and four different calibration lamp\n      intensity levels.  In triplet mode, elevation scanning was\n      repeated three times with three different diodes at every\n      azimuth position.  An unusual sampling mode effect was an\n      elevation shift when the step size did not match the diode\n      resolution.  There was a -5.6 deg elevation shift when using a\n      low resolution diode with high resolution stepping and a +5.6\n      deg shift when using a high resolution diode with low\n      resolution stepping.  These non-nominal modes were mostly used\n      to generate high resolution color images or to better resolve\n      the solar disk.  For the triplet mode, the specified diode was\n      the first of the three diodes, e.g., BLUE diode for a color\n      image.  Start and stop azimuths had to be multiples of 2.5 deg.\n      Center elevation had to be a multiple of 10 deg.  The elevation\n      range was determined by the step size with a range of about 20\n      deg for high resolution and about 60 deg for low resolution\n      since there was always 512 steps in an elevation scan.  Rescan\n      was done by inhibiting the azimuth rotation and repeatedly\n      scanning in elevation.  Rescan could be activated by commanding\n      the camera to operate for a time longer then it took to scan\n      the azimuth range of the image.\n \n \n    Principal Investigator\n    ======================\n      The principal investigator for the Viking Lander imaging system\n      during instrument development and the Viking Primary Mission\n      was Thomas A.  Mutch of Brown University.  From the Extended\n      Mission until the end of the Viking Mission, Raymond E.\n      Arvidson of Washington University was the lander imaging\n      principal investigator.",

	"display_description": "Instrument Overview\n  ===================\n    Each Viking Lander had identical Labeled Release (LR) instruments\n    that used two solid-state beta detectors (Geiger counters) to\n    measure the release of radioactive gas from samples of martian\n    soil that had been inoculated with an aqueous nutrient solution.\n    The instrument contained additional sensors to measure headspace\n    (i.e, the volume of test chamber above the sample) and detector\n    temperatures.  Heaters were also included in the LR instrument\n    for the detectors and test chambers.  A number of published\n    papers describe the characteristics and performance of the LR\n    instrument.  The scientific rationale and early design of the\n    instrument are described in LEVIN1972 and a detailed description\n    of the flight module is given in LEVIN&STRAAT1976A.  A summary of\n    the information from these papers is given here as a high-level\n    description of the LR instrument and its operation.  The Labeled\n    Release instrument was part of a package of three biology\n    experiments on the Viking Landers [KLEIN1974].\n \n \n  Science Objectives\n  ==================\n    The major scientific objectives of the Viking Lander biology\n    investigation were to detect the plausibility and/or presence of\n    life on Mars.  In particular, the LR experiment was designed to\n    detect microbial life in the martian soil.  The Labeled Release\n    experiment tested for heterotrophic metabolism by monitoring the\n    release of radioactive gases from a soil sample inoculated with\n    carbon-14 labeled organic substrates.  The experiment also was\n    designed to analyze control samples that were heat sterilized.\n \n    Several assumptions were used in the design and operation of the\n    Labeled Release experiment.  These assumptions included the\n    following: A) life on Mars was carbon based; B) one or more of\n    the nutrient compounds would be metabolized by possible microbial\n    life; and C) one end product of metabolism would be a carbon\n    based gas.\n \n \n  LR Detailed Description\n  =======================\n    The Labeled Release instrument contained four incubation test\n    cells mounted on a carousel.  Each test cell could be rotated and\n    sealed beneath an assembly that contained a heater, plumbing\n    terminals for nutrient delivery and gas removal, and a tube\n    leading to the beta detectors.  Gas and nutrient moving through\n    the plumbing system were controlled by eight miniaturized\n    solenoid valves.  The headspace was connected to the two\n    solid-state beta detectors through a tube bent at several spots.\n    The connecting tube was bent to prevent radioactive particles\n    from reaching the detectors from the test cell.  The instrument\n    also had two temperature sensors.  One sensor measured the\n    temperature of the detectors and the other measured the\n    temperature of the headspace within the test cell.  For a\n    schematic and photographs of the Labeled Release instrument see\n    LEVIN&STRAAT1976A.\n \n    The Labeled Release nutrient was stored in a sealed glass ampoule\n    within a reservoir.  The reservoir, in turn, was connected to the\n    test cells by the instrument plumbing system.  The ampoule\n    containing the nutrient was broken by a mechanical striker driven\n    by high pressure helium shortly after the spacecraft landed on\n    the surface of Mars.  Low pressure helium was then bubbled\n    through the nutrient in the reservoir for several hours in order\n    to degas the nutrient.  At the start of an analysis cycle high\n    pressure helium was used to route a portion of the nutrient into\n    a sealed test cell.  Testing prior to launch indicated that 0.115\n    cc +/- 8% of nutrient was delivered during each injection.  The\n    pressure in the test cell headspace was kept above Mars ambient\n    atmospheric pressure with helium from the plumbing system to\n    prevent boiling of the nutrient.  The total pressure at the start\n    of an analysis cycle was about 9200 Pa (92 millibar).  At the end\n    of an analysis cycle, radioactive gas was purged from the test\n    cell through the plumbing system.\n \n    The LR instrument had two identical solid-state beta detectors\n    (Geiger counters) to monitor the evolved radioactive gas from the\n    soil sample.  There were two detectors as a contingency against\n    failure of one detector.  The detectors continuously counted\n    gaseous radioactivity as it evolved from the test cell.  The\n    instrument could be commanded to count with either one or both\n    detectors.  Detectors were referred to as the right and left\n    channels.  The Viking Landers were powered by radioisotope\n    thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which provided background\n    radiation to the detectors.  As a result, this background signal\n    had to be determined by monitoring the detectors for one to\n    several Mars days before nutrient was injected into a test cell.\n \n    The test cell heaters were used in a number of ways.  Samples\n    could be heated in the test cell prior to nutrient injections to\n    provide sterilized control samples.  During an analysis cycle the\n    test cell was heated to prevent the temperature from falling\n    below 9-10 degree C during the martian night.  The heater was\n    also used at the end of an analysis cycle to dry the sample.\n \n    The Labeled Release instrument shared common support services\n    with the other biology instruments.  This included the sample\n    delivery system [KLEIN1974].  Martian soil samples were collected\n    by the Viking Lander surface sampler arm [MOOREETAL1987;\n    CROUCH1977].  Soil from the sampler arm was dumped into a hopper\n    on top of the lander.  The hopper contained a sieve that only\n    allowed particles less than 2 mm in size to enter the instrument\n    test cells.  The sieved samples entered a distribution assembly\n    that automatically delivered measured volumes of soil to each\n    biology experiment [KLEIN1974].  The Labeled Release instrument\n    typically received 0.5 cc of soil.\n \n    The Biology common support services and the Labeled Release\n    instrument held enough nutrient and helium to conduct up to two\n    injections on four soil samples.  Testing prior to launch showed\n    that after proper drying of a soil sample and purging of gases\n    from a test cell that the cell could be used a second time by\n    adding more soil and nutrient.  One of the test cells on Viking\n    Lander 2 was used a second time.\n \n \n  Nutrient Description\n  ====================\n    Considerable effort went into selecting, preparing, and testing\n    the nutrients for the Label Release experiment\n    [LEVIN&STRAAT1976A].  Selection criteria were partially based on\n    the assumption that life evolved similarly on Mars as on Earth.\n    There were several criteria used in selecting compounds for the\n    nutrient that included: A) Compounds that were likely to be\n    produced on Mars; B) Compounds that primitive organisms were\n    likely to use in metabolism based on terrestrial analogs; and C)\n    Compounds that were unlikely to have nonbiological reactions with\n    martian soil.  In addition, each compound in the nutrient was\n    tested to show that it produced a rapid response in a variety of\n    terrestrial soils and in cultures of several types of organisms.\n    The stability of the materials was also considered given that the\n    nutrient was stored for about 2 years from the time it was\n    prepared until it was used on Mars.  The storage period included\n    the nearly one year cruise phase of the spacecraft on its journey\n    to Mars.  Nutrient material also had to undergo sterilization of\n    the biology module (54 hr at 120 degree C) and the entire\n    spacecraft (20 hr at 100 degree C).  It was expected that some\n    decomposition (<1%) of the nutrient would occur due to the long\n    storage time and sterilization.  Any radioactive carbon dioxide\n    produced by the nutrient decomposition was removed by flushing\n    the nutrient reservoir with helium before the first injection.  A\n    complete list of nutrient compounds is given in\n    LEVIN&STRAAT1976A.  The nutrient included sodium formate, calcium\n    glycolate, glycine, D- and L-alanine, sodium D-lactate and sodium\n    L-lactate.  The concentrations of each nutrient component were\n    dilute in case any particular compound was toxic to possible\n    martian organisms.  Each compound in the nutrient was labeled\n    with a precise amount of radioactive carbon-14.\n \n \n  Operation and Sampling Modes\n  ============================\n    The basic analysis cycle for the Labeled Release experiment was\n    to have a sample of martian soil delivered to a test cell and to\n    be moistened with an aqueous solution of carbon-14 labeled\n    organic media.  A second nutrient injection was typically done\n    about 7-8 Mars days after the first injection.  The headspace\n    above the sample was monitored continuously for evolved\n    radioactive gas as evidence for metabolism.  Viking Lander 1\n    completed four cycles, whereas Viking Lander 2 completed five\n    cycles for a total of nine cycles between the two landers.  VL2\n    cycle 5 was performed in a previously used test cell using a\n    stored portion of the cycle 4 soil sample.  Eight of the cycles\n    received two injections of nutrient.  VL1 cycle 3 received three\n    injections of nutrient.\n \n    Three of the analysis cycles were control cycles where the soil\n    sample was heated for several hours before nutrient injection.\n    The control cycle for Viking Lander 1 was heated to 160 degree C.\n    After receiving highly attenuated results from Viking Lander 1,\n    Viking Lander 2 control cycles were modified to be 50 degree C.\n \n    Radioactivity was counted for 16-minute intervals during an\n    analysis cycle, except for several hours around the time of\n    nutrient injection where intervals of 2- to 4-minutes were used.\n    Background levels were determined by measuring the test cell for\n    several Mars days prior to nutrient injection.  The headspace and\n    detector temperatures were measured every 16 minutes throughout\n    an analysis cycle.\n \n    At the end of the cycle, the radioactive gas was removed by\n    purging and the soil was dried by brief heating to prevent\n    evaporation upon opening the cell.  A fresh test cell was then\n    rotated beneath the head end assembly and a three-hour cleanup\n    was accomplished by heating both the head assembly and detectors\n    during continuous helium purging.  After cooling, trapped\n    nutrient was vented from the system.\n \n    The instrument was fairly automated with preprogrammed sequences.\n    Commands could be sent from the ground to change the\n    preprogrammed sequences to perform nutrient injections, to select\n    active or control sequences, to select a fresh soil sample, and\n    to initiate or terminate an analysis cycle.  Commands could be\n    sent to conduct single or double channel counting.\n \n \n  Principal Investigator\n  ======================\n    The principal investigator for the Viking Lander Labeled Release\n    experiment was Dr.  Gilbert V.  Levin of Biospherics, Inc.  Much\n    of the work on selecting the nutrient was directed by\n    Co-Investigator Dr.  Patricia Ann Straat.",

	"display_description": "An accelerometer is an instrument that measures the acceleration of the case of the sensor due to external forces. All accelerometers have a 'proof mass' and it is the tendency of the proof mass to move relative to the case that is a measure of the acceleration of the case. Early accelerometers produced output that was directly related to acceleration; but modern sensors integrate the internally measured signal, to reduce noise, and the output is proportional to the change in velocity over the integration time. In high precision accelerometers, like those on MGS, the proof mass is an electronically floating magnetic body. The electromagnetic field is varied to keep the proof mass stationary relative to the case. The voltage required to accomplish this is proportional to the acceleration. The accelerometers on MGS are sensitive to acceleration of the center of mass (c.m.) of the s/c, pseudo-accelerations (i.e., centrifugal) due to rigid motion of the s/c about the c.m., and differences in gravitational force at the proof mass and the c.m. of the s/c (gravity gradient). The MGS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) contains four accelerometers. The principal accelerometer used in the aerobraking analysis is the z-axis accelerometer. This accelerometer is located at approximately (-0.44, -0.38, 0.72) m relative to the center of mass. The accelerometers are Sundstrand QA1200-AA08 model Q-Flex and continuously integrate acceleration to obtain velocity data. The instrument is sampled every 0.1 seconds. The data are recorded in instrument counts or quantized velocity increments equivalent to 0.332 mm/s per count. The QA1200 bias has a specified temperature sensitivity of 10 mg/K or approximately 0.3 counts/K. The temperature of the IMU assembly is actively controlled. IMU telemetered temperatures are quantized at 0.12 K and typical changes during an entire aerobraking pass are between two quantized values. Consequently, only a single, constant bias is determined for each pass through the atmosphere.",

The Mini-TES is a Fourier Transform Spectrometer covering the spectral range 5-29 micrometers (339.50 to 1997.06 cm-1) with a spectral sample interval of 9.99 cm-1. The Mini-TES telescope is a 6.35-cm diameter Cassegrain telescope that feeds a flat-plate Michelson moving mirror mounted on a voice-coil motor assembly. A single deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) uncooled pyroelectric detector with proven space heritage gives a spatial resolution of 20 mrad; an actuated field stop can reduce the field of view to 8 mrad. Mini-TES is mounted within the Rover's Warm Electronics Box and views the terrain using its internal telescope looking up the hollow shaft of the Pancam Mast Assembly (PMA) to the fixed fold mirror and rotating elevation scan mirror in the PMA head located ~1.5 m above the ground. The PMA provides a full 360 degree of azimuth travel and views from 30 degrees above the nominal horizon to 50 degrees below. An interferogram is collected every two seconds, and transmitted to the Rover computer where the Fast Fourier Transform, spectral summing, lossless compression, and data formatting are performed prior to transmission to Earth. Radiometric calibration is provided by two calibration V-groove blackbody targets instrumented with platinum thermistor temperature sensors with absolute temperature calibration of +/-0.1 K. One calibration target is located inside the PMA head, the second is on the Rover deck. The Mini-TES temperature is expected to vary diurnally from 263 to 303 K, with most surface composition data collected at scene temperatures >270 K. For these conditions the radiometric precision for two-spectra summing is +/-1.8 x10-8 W cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1 between 450 and 1500 cm-1, increasing to ~4.2 x10-8 W cm-2 sr-1 /cm-1 at shorter (300 cm-1) and longer (1800 cm-1) wavenumbers.

The worst-case sum of these random and systematic radiance errors correspond to an absolute temperature error of ~0.4 K for a true surface temperature of 270 K, and ~1.5 K for a surface at 180 K.

The velocity transducer operates at a nominal frequency of ~25 Hz and is configured with two 57Co/Rh MB sources. One source (~5 mCi landed intensity), together with a reference target (alpha-Fe2O3 plus alpha-Fe0) and PIN diode detector in transmission geometry, are internal to the sensor head and is used for instrument calibration. The other source (~150 mCi landed intensity), together with four PIN diodes in backscatter measurement geometry, irradiates Martian surface materials with a beam diameter of ~1.4 cm after passing through a collimator. Physical contact with surface materials is sensed with a switch-activated contact plate. The contact plate and internal reference target are instrumented with temperature sensors. Assuming ~18% Fe for Martian surface materials, experiment time is 6-12 hours during the night for quality spectra (i.e., good counting statistics); 1-2 hours is sufficient to identify and quantify the most abundant Fe-bearing phases. Data stored internal to the instrument for selectable return to Earth include MB and pulse-height analysis spectra (256 channels each) for each of the five detectors in up to 13 temperature intervals (65 MB spectra), engineering data for the velocity transducer, and temperature measurements. The total data volume is ~150 kByte. The mass and power consumption are ~500 g (~400g for the sensor head) and ~2 W, respectively. The scientific measurement objectives of the MB investigation are to obtain for rock, soil, and dust (1) the mineralogical identification of iron-bearing phases (e.g., oxides, silicates, sulfides, sulfates, and carbonates), (2) the quantitative measurement of the distribution of iron among these iron-bearing phases (e.g., the relative proportions of iron in olivine, pyroxenes, ilmenite and magnetite in a basalt), and (3) the quantitative measurement of the distribution of iron among its oxidation states (e.g., Fe2+, Fe3+, and Fe6+).

The four LN-200S units employed in the mission were selected from a larger population for improved stability. These LN-200S IMU's provide three-axis rotation rate and acceleration measurements.  The rotation rate is provided by a Fiber Optic Gyro (FOG) sensor, while the accelerations are provided by silicon accelerometers.  Each IMU contains three FOGs and three accelerometers, oriented orthogonally to provide measurements in three dimensions simultaneously.  The resultant measurements from each of the accelerometers and each of the FOGs is spatially transformed to the center of the IMU prior to being output by the instrument. Each IMU has a mass of 0.75 kg (1.65 pound weight), is ~9 cm by 9 cm in size, and is operated at 12 watts.  These LN-200S IMU's have space flight heritage, having been successfully flown on the Clementine mission. The accelerometers within each IMU had a dynamic range of 80g (where g here represents Earth's standard surface gravitational acceleration of 9.80665 meters per second per second) and a resolution of 2.4 milli g's, with a noise level of 1.6 milli g's when sampled at 400 Hz (the nominal instrument sampling rate). The spacecraft could not handle 400 Hz sampling, so the IMU data were summed over 50 measurements, resulting in an 8 Hz sampling by the spacecraft.  This summing has the effect of reducing the the effective noise to 300 micro g's, with an effective resolution of 50 micro g's. Atmospheric entry occurred at a nominal height of 128 km above the Mars surface at a nominal atmospheric relative velocity of 5400 m/s.  The frictional drag of the atmosphere upon the entry vehicle results in a reduction in the speed of the entry vehicle. This deceleration is measured by the accelerometers within the IMU, while the orientation of the entry vehicle is provided by the gyroscope measurements. The FOGs also provided relative orientation information for both the backshell and the lander after parachute deployment, which occurred approximately 240 seconds after entry at an altitude approximately 8.5 kilometers above the surface.  The lander separated from the backshell and descended on a tether approximately 30 seconds after parachute deployment.  Subsequent simultaneous backshell and lander (rover) IMU measurements in this tethered condition allow for the 'swing' of the lander on the tether to be determined.  This enabled removal of this motion from the accelerometer measurements, permitting a determination of the net motion of the lander toward the surface.  This allows for atmospheric profile reconstruction while the lander is still attached to the parachute.  These measurements (as well as the descent imaging) also served as part of the guidance for the horizontal motion reduction system which was included to minimize lander horizontal motion upon initial impact with the surface. The bridle connecting the lander to the backshell was severed approximately three seconds prior to surface impact.  The backshell IMU measurements ceased upon the severing of this connection.",

Pancam also provides mission support measurements for the rovers, including Sun-finding for rover navigation; hazard identification and digital terrain modeling to help guide long-term rover traverse decisions; high resolution imaging to help guide the selection of in situ sampling targets; and acquisition of education and public outreach products. The Pancam optical, mechanical, and electronics design were optimized to achieve these science and mission support goals.

The miniature MB spectrometer MIMOS II is a component of the Athena science payload to be launched to Mars in 2003 on both Mars Exploration Rover missions. The instrument has two major components: (1) a rover-based electronics board which contains power supplies, a dedicated central processing unit, memory, and associated support electronics and (2) a sensor head that is mounted at the end of the instrument deployment device (IDD) for placement of the instrument in physical contact with soil and rock. The velocity transducer operates at a nominal frequency of ~25 Hz and is configured with two 57Co/Rh MB sources. One source (~5 mCi landed intensity), together with a reference target (alpha-Fe2O3 plus alpha-Fe0) and PIN diode detector in transmission geometry, are internal to the sensor head and is used for instrument calibration. The other source (~150 mCi landed intensity), together with four PIN diodes in backscatter measurement geometry, irradiates Martian surface materials with a beam diameter of ~1.4 cm after passing through a collimator. Physical contact with surface materials is sensed with a switch-activated contact plate. The contact plate and internal reference target are instrumented with temperature sensors. Assuming ~18% Fe for Martian surface materials, experiment time is 6-12 hours during the night for quality spectra (i.e., good counting statistics); 1-2 hours is sufficient to identify and quantify the most abundant Fe-bearing phases. Data stored internal to the instrument for selectable return to Earth include MB and pulse-height analysis spectra (256 channels each) for each of the five detectors in up to 13 temperature intervals (65 MB spectra), engineering data for the velocity transducer, and temperature measurements. The total data volume is ~150 kByte. The mass and power consumption are ~500 g (~400g for the sensor head) and ~2 W, respectively. The scientific measurement objectives of the MB investigation are to obtain for rock, soil, and dust (1) the mineralogical identification of iron-bearing phases (e.g., oxides, silicates, sulfides, sulfates, and carbonates), (2) the quantitative measurement of the distribution of iron among these iron-bearing phases (e.g., the relative proportions of iron in olivine, pyroxenes, ilmenite and magnetite in a basalt), and (3) the quantitative measurement of the distribution of iron among its oxidation states (e.g., Fe2+, Fe3+, and Fe6+). Special geologic targets of the MB investigation are dust collected by the Athena magnets and exterior and interior rock and soil surfaces exposed by the Athena Rock Abrasion Tool and by trenching with rover wheels, respectively.",

	"display_description": "The Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) represents NASA's third attempt to\n    observe Martian weather and monitor the planet's climate using\n    modern infrared remote sensing techniques, including limb sounding.\n \n    The campaign began in 1986 with the Pressure Modulator Infrared\n    Radiometer (PMIRR) [MCCLEESEETAL1986; MCCLEESEETAL1992] on the Mars\n    Observer mission, which was lost in 1993 during the final\n    pressurization of the spacecraft propulsion system only a few days\n    prior to Mars orbit insertion (MOI). NASA re-selected that\n    scientific investigation, including an enlarged science team and\n    using the same PMIRR instrument design, for another mission, the\n    Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO). Launched in 1998, the MCO spacecraft\n    entered the Martian atmosphere during MOI and was destroyed. NASA\n    selected the same team once more to build the new MCS instrument\n    now onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). MCS is not a\n    copy of the PMIRR instrument launched in 1992, as the 1998 PMIRR II\n    was, but is a smaller, lighter instrument with the same scientific\n    objectives as those of the previous two investigations.\n \n    The Mars Climate Sounder is the first custom designed infrared\n    sounder for systematic meteorological measurements at Mars, using\n    the limb viewing technique to obtain relatively high vertical\n    resolution of better than one pressure scale height.\n \n    The application of modern technology and the use of new high\n    performance, linear array thermopile detectors with focal plane\n    signal processing and miniature multilayer interference and mesh\n    filters has permitted a fivefold reduction in mass, in part by the\n    elimination of the requirement for cryogenic operation of the focal\n    plane.\n \n    The compact dimensions of the design allow the entire instrument to\n    be pointed to limb or nadir, for atmospheric and surface mapping\n    respectively, and special patterns to be implemented, for example\n    for mapping over the poles where the complex physics of the energy\n    balance and atmospheric response during the long winter night is to\n    be addressed.",

The most common usage of this telemetry type is as\n    a reply to routine requests including turning on LEDs for imaging,\n    moving the microscope sample stage, deploying a chemistry actuator\n    (sample drawer, water release, or stirring motor), or simply a status\n    inquiry.

A second usage of this telemetry type is in\n    response to a 'raw' command, a direct instruction to the FPGA to execute\n    any of its allowed functions. While not recommended for routine science\n    measurements, this mode is often used for operations that are not\n    performed in the desired sequence by the standard flight software\n    commands.

	"display_description": "The PHX entry capsule contained two Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)\n    mounted on the underside of the lander on opposite sides of the\n    spacecraft. Only one IMU was used during descent, entry and landing\n    (EDL). The other IMU was a backup device that was not turned on. The\n    Phoenix IMU is quasi-standard commercial product, sometimes called a\n    Miniature IMU, or MIMU [GARAVELLIETAL1995]. This particular device\n    was manufactured by Honeywell (Clearwater, FL) with model number\n    YG9666BC. The IMU used three Allied Signal QFLEX accelerometers for\n    linear acceleration measurement and three Honeywell GG1320 RLG\n    ring-laser gyros for angular rotation measurement. However, the IMU\n    was configured internally so that the linear accelerations were\n    integrated and output as linear velocity changes while the gyro\n    measurements were output as angle changes in a given sample time. No\n    input from scientists was possible concerning the device selection\n    and location within the lander, which was done by spacecraft\n    engineers for the cancelled NASA Mars 2001 Lander prior to the\n    initiation of the Phoenix project. The Phoenix lander was based on\n    the Mars 2001 Lander design. Consequently, the IMU used during EDL of\n    the Phoenix spacecraft was neither located at the entry vehicle\n    center of mass nor the spin axis, which otherwise would have been\n    desirable to optimize noise minimization for scientific purposes.\n \n    The instrument attributes for the PHX IMU are discussed in\n    [TAYLORETAL2008]. At a rate of 200 Hz, the IMU output the accumulated\n    linear velocity change (the time integral of acceleration) in three\n    Cartesian axes and accumulated angle change (the time integral of\n    angular rate) about three Cartesian axes. Data was saved onboard PHX\n    at the device output rate of 200 Hz and was not down-sampled.\n \n    The IMU had a mass of 3.52 kg and approximately 4051 cc volume.  Each\n    accelerometer within the IMU had a full-scale range of 36.8g (where g\n    represents Earth's standard surface gravitational acceleration of\n    9.80665 meters per second per second). The accelerometer and gyro\n    signals were electronically integrated inside the IMU to produce an\n    output of accumulated delta-v (linear velocity change) and delta-q\n    (angular velocity change) at 200 Hz.  The accelerometers had two\n    stages of digitization that resulted in pulses and then counts. The\n    final raw digital output from the IMU accelerometers was in counts,\n    in velocity units, where 1 output count = 0.0753 mm/sec.  But the\n    final output moved up and down in pulses, which are leaps of many\n    counts, with each pulse equivalent to 2.7 mm/sec. Thus, the amplitude\n    of one pulse was equivalent to 2.7/0.0753 = 35.86 counts, on\n    average. Added to this was noise in the system, which was on the\n    order of 1 count, so that jumps in the raw output were typically 36\n    or 37 counts. This determined the digital resolution of the raw 200\n    Hz data to be a delta-v of 2.7 mm/sec and typical noise level of\n    0.0753 mm/sec.\n \n    Individual gyros measure the angular rotation about one axis. Each\n    raw IMU gyro output is a 16 bit signed integer (i.e., from -32767 to\n    +32767) with the least significant bit (LSB) equivalent to 1\n    micro-radian. Because the data was generated at 200 Hz or every 5\n    millisecs, a full-scale value of 32768 would correspond to 375\n    deg/sec. (32,768 * 1 microradian /0.005 sec = 0.032768/0.005\n    radian/sec = 6.5536 rad/sec = 375 deg/sec). The smallest motion in a\n    200 Hz interval is one count, which corresponds to 0.01144 deg/sec (1\n    * 1 microradian /0.005 sec = 200 micro-rad/sec = 0.01144 deg/sec).\n    Smaller angular motions can be measured over longer time periods by\n    integration of the raw data. Noise on the raw gyro output is\n    estimated as 45 micro-radians (3 sigma).",

This affects local and global meteorological patterns which in\n    turn determine the lifting of dust from the surface and long range\n    transport [LEOVY2001; NEWMAN2002]. There is also a climate interaction\n    with the distribution of water ice above and below the surface of Mars\n    [BOYNTON2002, PATHAK2008]. This involves transport of water through the\n    atmosphere and previous lidar measurements from orbit have indicated that\n    clouds could have a substantial role [NEUMANN2003].\n \n    The lidar on the Phoenix mission will record the height profile of laser\n    backscatter from the dust and cloud layers that drift past the landing\n    site with a view that is continuous in time. The attenuation of the lidar\n    signal can be used to derive the optical extinction coefficient and this\n    is related to atmospheric properties. For example, the extinction of solar\n    radiation due to dust has a first order effect on heating of the surface\n    of Mars. The measured optical extinction can also be related to the amount\n    of scattering material. For example, for a thin cloud the extinction\n    coefficient measured by a lidar can be used to derive the ice water\n    content within the cloud [HEYMSFIELD2005]. Such a measurement will be of\n    vital importance to the mission goal to investigate water on Mars. The\n    combination of the lidar and passive remote sensing with in situ sampling\n    will provide a view of the interacting processes that determine the local\n    weather at the surface and also the role of the atmosphere in the water\n    cycle on Mars.\n \n    A basic atmospheric lidar (light detection and ranging) emits pulses of\n    laser light into the atmosphere then detects and records the backscattered\n    light as a function of time [MEASURES1984]. The time resolved signal is\n    converted to distance using the speed of light and a factor of two to\n    account for the round-trip path length.\n \n    The lidar transmitter is based on a diode pumped, passively Q-switched,\n    neodymium-doped yttrium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. This configuration was\n    chosen for its robustness and technological maturity as much as for its\n    suitable lidar performance. The pump diode array emits at a wavelength of\n    808 nm and is used to provide the energy to the Nd:YAG crystal within the\n    laser cavity. Lasing is inhibited within the cavity through the use of a\n    saturable absorber. The photon density within the oscillator cavity builds\n    to a level where the saturable absorber bleaches and the energy within the\n    cavity is dumped as a laser pulse over a very short time (a passive\n    Q-switch). For this laser the output light pulse has a length of\n    approximately 10 ns and an energy of 0.7 mJ.\n \n    After the laser cavity emits its light pulse, part of the optical energy\n    is converted from a wavelength of 1064 nm to 532 nm by second harmonic\n    generation in a Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) crystal. The laser\n    output is then expanded by a factor of 10 in order to reduce the\n    divergence to 0.5 mrad. A small fraction of the outgoing laser pulse is\n    'picked off' and separated into the two wavelength components in order to\n    measure the relative amplitude of each wavelength with photodiodes. The\n    signal from the photodiode detecting the 1064 nm pulse is used to trigger\n    the data acquisition electronics, providing a zero-time reference, and\n    also to shut off the pumping diodes.\n \n    The atmospheric backscatter signals are collected by an afocal reflective\n    telescope and split into the two relevant wavelengths using dichroic\n    mirrors. The 1064 nm backscatter is detected by an Avalanche Photo-Diode\n    (APD), and recorded using 14-bit analog to digital conversion (ADC). The\n    532 nm backscatter is detected by a Photomultiplier (PMT) and the signal\n    is recorded using both ADC and photon counting. Photon counting is\n    required to record the weak signals from heights above 5 km and up to\n    20 km.",

	"display_description": "The MECA Optical Microscope (OM) is part of the Microscopy, Electrochemistry\n    and Conductivity Analyzer (MECA) instrument suite. The optical, electronics,\n    and illumination systems were designed, integrated, and tested by the Lunar\n    and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) at the University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ. It\n    was integrated with the MECA platform, including the sample wheel and\n    translation stage (SWTS) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), at the Jet\n    Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, where flight qualification was also\n    performed. Charge Coupled Device (CCD) detector and readout electronics were\n    delivered by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS),\n    Katlenburg-Lindau, Germany. The OM is a fixed-focus imaging system utilizing\n    a 512 x 256 pixel active imaging area frame transfer CCD detector. It is\n    designed to acquire images of particulate Martian material (soil, dust) at a\n    spatial resolution of 4 microns/px. The samples to be imaged are moved to\n    the optimum focus distance (about 14 mm away from the front end of the lens\n    barrel) via a Sample Wheel Translation Stage (SWTS). The imaged area is then\n    2 mm * 1 mm. The samples are actively illuminated by red, green, blue or\n    ultraviolet Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). Color images of these samples can\n    be generated by combining individual images acquired with red, green and\n    blue illumination. The SWTS is shared by the OM and the Atomic Force\n    Microscope (AFM). It contains a total of 69 substrates: 10 sets of 6\n    substrates plus 9 substrates holding OM and AFM calibration targets. Each\n    set of 6 substrates consists of a weak and a strong magnet, 2 (identical)\n    microbuckets (empty holes, 2 mm deep, 3 mm in diameter) for bulk sampling, a\n    nanobucket (silicon textured substrate with micron-sized pits and pillar\n    features for fixing particles and retaining the original size distribution\n    of the acquired sample) and a sticky silicone substrate. The SWTS can be\n    positioned to extend any one of ten sets of 6 substrates out of the MECA\n    enclosure to receive soil samples from the Robot Arm (RA) or to collect\n    airfall dust. Excess material is removed by passing the substrates under a\n    blade positioned 0.2 mm above the surface, after which the samples are\n    rotated for imaging by the OM and AFM. The overall sensitivity of the OM\n    extends from 400 to 1020 nm and is chiefly controlled by the sensitivity of\n    the CCD (extending from 380 to 1020 nm) and by a Schott GG420 glass filter\n    (placed in between CCD and lens assembly) that blocks efficiently all light\n    in the spectral range 380-400 nm. Therefore UV LED radiation (central\n    wavelength ~ 375 nm and spectral width ~ 12 nm) cannot be directly detected\n    by the CCD. Illuminating the target material with ultraviolet light can thus\n    reveal fluorescence of that material. OM images belong to a series of images\n    (Surface Stereo Imager (SSI), Robotic Arm Camera (RAC), AFM) that inspect\n    areas of decreasing size with increasing resolution. OM images will be used\n    to place AFM data in context.",

They were all calibrated with respect to geometric\n    flat field response, detector dark current, camera absolute\n    responsivity, detector noise performance, and detector gain.\n \n \n  Detectors\n  =========\n \n    Each Hazcam uses a 1024 x 2048 pixel CCD with 12 micron-square\n    pixels and a 100% optical fill factor. The CCDs operate in frame-\n    transfer mode, dividing the detector into two regions. One of the\n    regions is a 1204 x 1204 pixel photosensitive imaging region where\n    the image is recorded. The other region is a 1204 x 1204 shielded\n    storage region where the recorded image is shifted and stored during\n    detector readout. It takes 5.1 msec to transfer data from the\n    imaging region to the storage region, and 5.4 seconds for readout of\n    data from the storage region. Each CCD includes 32 non-imaging\n    pixels in the serial readout registers, which allow the monitoring\n    of the CCD electronics offset and detector noise performance. The\n    Hazcam CCD pixels have full well capacities of approximately 170,000\n    electrons and are digitized at 12 bits/ pixel. The RMS read noise\n    at cold temperatures (-55 degrees C) is approximately 20 electrons,\n    and the detector system has gain values of approximately 50 e-/DN,\n    which results in a system with approximately 0.5 DN of RMS read\n    noise.\n \n    The absolute quantum efficiency (QE) of the CCDs has been measured\n    between 400 and 1000 nm at four operating temperatures ranging from\n    218 K and 278 K. The QE of the MSL CCDs is typical of a silicon CCD\n    detector, with sensitivity peaking at 700 nm with a QE value of\n    approximately 43%. The SNR of the detector system is essentially\n    Poisson-limited because of its low readout noise and small dark\n    current rates in the Martian operating envirionments.\n \n \n  Electronics\n  ===========\n \n    The Hazcam CCDs use a 'clocked antiblooming' readout technique,\n    instead of having anti-blooming circuitry. The proper choice of\n    autoexposure parameters prevent the blooming effect.\n \n    The Hazcams also have the capability for onboard image processing.\n    The Hazcams can do pixel summation in which they sum the rows and\n    columns of an image, returning the results in a one-dimensional\n    array of 32-bit integers whose length is the image height. These\n    are very useful when the spatial content of an image has relatively\n    low scene entropy and the emphasis is on the radiometry. The flight\n    software (FSW) can also calculate and return the histogram of an\n    image, which can be useful for atmospheric observations. Hazcam\n    images can be spatially downsampled to a user-specified image size\n    using one of a few techniques; nearest neighbor computation of the\n    mean, computation of the mean with outlier rejection, and median\n    averaging. The FSW also allows the option to downlink a subframed\n    region of an image so full resolution can be downlinked at a lower\n    data volume. The FSW is also capable of lossy and lossless\n    compression of MER images. The rovers will use a ICER wavelet image\n    compressor for the lossy and lossless compression.\n \n \n  Filters\n  =======\n \n    The Hazcams use a combination of three filters (Schott OG590,\n    KG5, and ND1.3) to create a red bandpass filter centered at\n    650 nm and a FWHM of approximately 140 nm.\n \n \n  Optics\n  ======\n \n    The Hazcams have f/15 cameras with a 5.58 nm focal length. The\n    Hazcam optics are f-theta fisheye lenses with 124 degree x 124\n    degree horizontal/ vertical field of view and a 180 degree diagonal\n    field of view. They have an angular resolution at the center of the\n    picture of 2.1 milliradians/pixel. The nominal exposure time for a\n    noontime image on Mars is approximately .25 seconds. This time is 50\n    times the frame transfer time of 5.1 ms. This ensures that the image\n    signal is significantly than the image smear acquired during the\n    frame transfer. The spectral range of the Hazcams is 600-800 nm.\n \n \n  Covers\n  ======\n \n    Each Hazcam pair has a cover assembly with Lexan windows to protect\n    the cameras from debris during descent and landing. After landing,\n    before the Hazcams are used for imaging, the covers will pop open\n    and never be closed again.",

The MSL APXS takes advantage of a combination of\n    the terrestrial standard methods Particle-Induced X-ray Emission\n    (PIXE) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) to determine elemental chemistry.\n    It uses curium-244 sources for X-ray spectroscopy to determine the\n    abundance of major elements down to trace elements from sodium to\n    bromine and beyond.\n \n    The instrument consists of a main electronics unit in the rover's\n    body and a sensor head mounted on the robotic arm. Measurements\n    are taken by deploying the sensor head towards a desired sample,\n    placing the sensor head in contact or hovering typically less than\n    2 cm away, and measuring the emitted X-ray spectrum for 15 minutes\n    to 3 hours without the need of further interaction by the rover.\n    At the end of the measurement, the rover retrieves the science\n    data of 32 kilobytes, containing up to 13 consecutively taken\n    spectra and engineering data. The internal APXS software splits\n    the total measurement into equal time slots with an adjustable\n    cycle time parameter. This allows us to check for repeatability\n    and to select spectra with sufficient spectral quality.\n \n    The MSL APXS can activate an internal Peltier cooler for the X-ray\n    detector chip. This results in a sufficient spectral resolution\n    (FWHM) of below 200 eV at 6.4 keV below ~ -5 deg C and best FWHM of <\n    150 eV below ~ -15 deg C environmental temperature. Compared to the\n    APXS on MER, where the best FWHM was reached at temperatures below\n    ~ -45 deg C, this allows a significantly larger operational time\n    window for APXS analysis.\n \n    The MSL APXS has approximately 3 times the sensitivity for low Z\n    (atomic number) elements and approximately 6 times for higher Z\n    elements than the MER APXS. A full analysis with detection limits\n    of 100 ppm for Ni and ~ 20 ppm for Br now requires 3 hours, while\n    quick look analysis for major and minor elements at ~ 0.5%\n    abundance, such as Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe, or S, can be done in 10\n    minutes or less.\n \n    On MER, the elements detected by the APXS in rock and soil samples\n    are typically Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni,\n    Zn, and Br [RIEDERETAL2004] [GELLERTETAL2006].\n    Elevated levels of Ge, Ga, Pb, and Rb were found in some of the\n    MER samples [CLARKETAL2007].\n \n    The sampled area is about 1.7 cm in diameter when the instrument\n    is in contact with the sample. A standoff results in gradually\n    lower intensity and an increased diameter of the measured spot.\n    Low Z element X-rays stem from the topmost 5 microns of the\n    sample, higher Z elements like Fe are detected from the upper ~50\n    microns. Sample preparation is not needed; the APXS results\n    average the composition over the sampled area and the oxide\n    abundances measured are renormalized to 100%. However, on MSL, a\n    dust removal tool (brush) is available to remove loose material\n    from a rock surface before making an APXS measurement.\n \n    The major improvements and changes compared to the MER APXS are:\n \n        * Improved sensitivity by a factor 3 giving full analysis\n          within ~3 hours\n        * Additional improved sensitivity for high Z elements by\n          increased X-ray source strength\n        * Operable during Martian day by using Peltier cooler for the\n          X-ray detector\n        * Basaltic calibration target mounted on the rover (on the\n          robotic arm azimuth actuator housing), dedicated for the APXS\n        * No alpha channel (no Rutherford Backscattering spectroscopy)\n        * Compressed short duration X-ray spectra ( ~10 seconds ) can\n          be used to steer the arm movement in a 'proximity mode'",

Each\n    hour, every sol, REMS will record 5 minutes of data at 1 Hz for\n    all sensors. This strategy will be implemented based on a high\n    degree of autonomy in REMS operations. The instrument will wake\n    itself up each hour and after recording and storing data, will go\n    to sleep independently of rover operations. REMS will record data\n    whether the rover is awake or not, and both day and night.\n \n    REMS operation is designed assuming a minimum of three hours of\n    operation each day, primarily constrained by power\n    availability. Since the hourly observations will use a total of\n    two hours of operational time, the third hour can be scheduled as\n    a continuous block, for example. Another option that has been\n    implemented in REMS flight software is a simple algorithm to\n    lengthen some of the regular observations autonomously when an\n    atmospheric event is detected. Depending on resources available\n    during the mission, and the science team wishes, REMS can operate\n    more than three hours per day.\n \n    REMS instrument is formed by four main subsets:\n \n    - ICU (instrument Control Unit), allowing power conditioning and\n      distribution, analog acquisition and control of some of the\n      sensor, thermal control loops, communications with the Booms and\n      data processing and communications with the RCE. The ICU is\n      composed of three boards: CPU, Analog and a DC/DC Converter. The\n      Analog board also integrates the Pressure Sensor (PS).\n \n    - Ultraviolet Sensor (UV), consisting of 6 photodiodes, each one\n      devoted to a different measurement band.\n \n    - Boom 1, hosting an Air Temperature Sensor (ATS), a Wind Sensor\n      (WS), the Ground Temperature Sensor (GTS) and the front-end ASIC\n      that processes all the received analog inputs from the\n      transducers and sends the data to the ICU via a transmission\n      link.\n \n    - Boom 2, hosting another Air Temperature Sensor, another Wind\n      Sensor, the Humidity Sensor (HS) and other front-end ASIC that\n      also processes all the received analog inputs from the\n      transducers and sends the data to the ICU via a transmission\n      link.\n \n    Booms are to be located orthogonal to the rover mast, with boom 1\n    looking to the side and slightly to the rear of the rover, while\n    boom 2 points in the driving direction of the rover. The UVS is\n    going to be placed on top of the Rover Deck and the ICU is to be\n    located inside the warm body of the rover.",
