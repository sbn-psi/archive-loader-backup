Six experiments were carried as part of the science payload: television, ultraviolet spectrometer, infrared spectroscopy, infrared radiometry, S-band occultation and celestial mechanics. Two experiments (S-band occultation and celestial mechanics) utilized the radio telemetry subsystem to derive data; the other required specially developed instruments, mounted, and boresighted to each other, on the spacecraft's scan platform. Pre-launch mission planning encompassed two separate, but complementary, missions. The orbit of each spacecraft was optimized to match the corresponding objective. The mapping mission was designed with an Earth-synchronous orbit (about a 12-hr periods) to maximize antenna utilization, or communications efficiency. For maximum surveillance of an area, it was designed with a steep inclination (80 degrees) to the equatorial plane of Mars. The dynamic objective dictated a Mars-synchronous (or sub-synchronous) orbit and a lower (50 degree) inclination for closer observations of specific areas. The plans for the two missions were in detailed stages of development on May 9, 1971 when Mariner 8 was lost because of guidance difficulties in the second stage of the launch vehicle. It was determined that an orbit for a single-spacecraft mission could be developed to meet all basic mission and specific science objectives. A single-spacecraft plan, involving an inclination of 65 degrees, a period of about 12 hours, a periapsis altitude of 1350 Km, and an arrival date of November 14, 1971, was evaluated and formalized in 2 weeks.","image_url":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/web/mariner9.jpg","funding_level":"N/A"},{"display_name":"Viking 1 and 2","display_description":"The Viking mission to Mars consisted of four spacecraft: the two orbiters VO1 and VO2, and the landers VL1 and VL2 [SOFFEN1977]. During cruise to Mars the landers were attached to the orbiters; the combined spacecraft were then known as Viking 1 and 2. The role of the orbiters was to transport the landers to Mars, to carry reconnaissance instruments for certifying the landing sites, to act as relay stations for lander data, and to perform their own scientific investigations. The initial orbit periapses were placed over the candidate landing sites to allow for maximum viewing resolution and relay of the lander data. After the primary lander missions were completed, the orbiters' orbits were allowed to drift so that the entire planetary surface could be systematically mapped by the three remote sensing experiments. The Viking 1 spacecraft was launched August 20, 1975, and arrived at Mars on June 19, 1976. Lander 1 was deployed to the Mars surface on July 20, 1976. The VO1 orbital inclination of 38-39 degrees was chosen to optimize communication with VL1. Viking 2 was launched September 9, 1975 and arrived at Mars August 7, 1976. VL2 landed on September 3, 1976, at a more northerly site than VL1. The VO2 orbit was correspondingly more inclined than VO1; initially 55 degrees, it was later adjusted to 80 degrees, providing particularly good coverage of polar regions.

On August 21, 1993, flight controllers lost contact with the Mars Observer spacecraft when an expected transmission that was part of the pre-Mars-Orbit-Insertion sequence failed to occur. Subsequent attempts to re-establish communication with the spacecraft proved unsuccessful. After the 11-month transit the spacecraft was to be injected into an elliptical orbit around Mars with periapsis near the north pole. The orbit would then be adjusted through a series of maneuvers to a near-circular, sun-synchronous (2 am/pm), low altitude, near-polar orbit. Due to the non-uniformity of the gravity field, the altitude was to vary from 376 km near the south pole to 430 km near the north pole. During the Martian year in this mapping orbit the instruments were to acquire data in a systematic program of global mapping. At the end of the mission the spacecraft could have been boosted to a permanent quarantine orbit. The Mars orbit insertion (MOI) period was to end one month before solar conjunction and the beginning of the dust storm period. The playback data rate for a 10-hour link would vary by a factor of 4 with Earth-Mars distance during the mission. The continuous data rate to the tape recorders was about one fifth the playback rate for a 10-hour link to a 34 m NASA Deep Space Network tracking station. The normal sequence of collecting scientific data would be to record continuously for 24 hours and then to play the data back in one 10-hour link. The mapping orbit would be a 117-minute orbit with a 7-day repeat cycle. As a result, the planet would be repeatedly mapped in 26-day cycles with a 58.6 km nominal path separation. Orbit trim adjustments would make it possible to obtain uniform coverage during the course of the mission with an ultimate spacing of ground tracks at the equator or 3.1 km. The Mars Observer spacecraft provided a three-axis stabilized, nadir-oriented platform for the continuous observations of Mars by the science instruments. The spacecraft was built by the General Electric Astro-Space Division. The Gamma Ray Spectrometer and Magnetometer sensor assemblies were mounted on individual booms on the spacecraft. All other instruments were rigidly mounted to the spacecraft structure. No movable scan platform was provided; the spacecraft was to be continuously nadir pointed, rotating at the orbital rate.

At launch Odyssey weighed 729.7 kilograms (1606.7 pounds), including the 331.8 kilogram (731.5 pound) dry spacecraft with all of its subsystems, 353.4 kilograms (779.1 pounds) of fuel and 44.5 kilograms (98.1 pounds) of instruments. The spacecraft traveled more than 460 million kilometers over the course of a 200-day cruise period to reach Mars on 2001-10-24. Upon reaching Mars, Odyssey fired its main rocket engine for a 19-minute Mars orbit insertion (MOI) burn. This maneuver slowed the spacecraft and allowed the planet's gravity to capture it into orbit. Initially, Odyssey whirled around the red planet in a highly elliptical orbit that took 45 hours to complete. After orbit insertion, Odyssey performed a series of orbit changes to drop the low point of its orbit into the upper fringes of the Martian atmosphere at an altitude of about 110 kilometers. During every atmospheric pass, the spacecraft slowed by a small amount because of air resistance. This slowing caused the spacecraft to lose altitude on its next pass through the atmosphere. Odyssey used this aerobraking technique over a period of three months to transition from an elliptical orbit into a 400 km nearly circular orbit for mapping. Mars Odyssey was intended to last for more than 2 full Mars years, or 1374 days. The orbiter had its own science mission and also acted as a relay for landed Mars missions in 2004. The primary mapping mission began in February 2002 and lasted until August 2004 for a total of 917 days. An extended mission then took place through the end of September 2006. The inclination of the science orbit was 93.1 degrees, resulting in a nearly Sun- synchronous orbit [JPLD-16303]. The orbit period was just under two hours. The spacecraft was three-axis stabilized and powered by solar cells. It was built of lightweight composite materials and divided into two sub-assemblies: the equipment module and the propulsion module. The equipment module consisted of two decks - the equipment deck, containing engineering equipment and one science instrument, the Martian Radiation Environment Experiment (MARIE), and the science deck, which housed the remainder of the science instruments and other engineering components. Mars Odyssey carried three on-board science instruments. The Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) worked both in the visible and infrared spectral regions. It took multi-spectral thermal-infrared images to determine the surface mineralogy at a global scale and also acquired visible images with a per-pixel resolution of 18 meters (59 feet). The Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) measured gamma rays emitted from the surface of Mars to determine the elemental composition of the surface, including mapping water deposits in water-ice form. It also studied cosmic gamma ray bursts. GRS was actually a suite of three instruments - the Gamma Ray Spectrometer, the Neuron Spectrometer (NS) and the High-Energy Neutron Detector (HEND). GRS and THEMIS could not operate at the same time due to conflicts in the parameters necessary for operation. The third instrument, the Martian Radiation Environment Experiment (MARIE), was intended to operate continuously throughout the science mission to collect data about the radiation environment of the planet. Flight commanders turned off MARIE on 2001-08-18 because the instrument failed to reset after it did not respond during a downlink session the previous week. It was turned on again in early March 2002 after the mapping orbit had been established. MARIE operated from that time until it was disabled following an intense solar particle event on October 29, 2003. Before being disabled, the instrument showed abnormally high current draw and temperatures. Throughout November and early December of 2003, after the solar event subsided and after Odyssey recovered from entering safe mode, the Odyssey team attempted unsuccessfully to reestablish communication with MARIE. Two other instruments aboard Odyssey were, like MARIE, sensitive to energetic charged particles. The first instrument was the gamma detector on GRS, which used a large germanium crystal to detects gamma rays coming from the Martian surface. The detection of gamma rays depended on the deposition of energy in the crystal by the incident photons. Charged particles also deposited energy in the crystal. The second non-MARIE instrument aboard Odyssey that was sensitive to charged particles was the scintillation block in the high energy neutron detector (HEND, an element of the GRS suite). The 'external' detector was a cesium-iodide (CsI) scintillator surrounding a stilbene crystal scintillator that was used for high-energy neutron detection. These two detectors were available to continue the monitoring of aspects of the radiation environment at Mars that was conducted by MARIE during Odyssey's cruise and prime mission phases. The local mean solar time (LMST) at the start of the Odyssey mission was approximately 4:00 p.m. and was later frozen by a maneuver to approximately 5:00 p.m. The local true solar time (LTST) oscillated about 45 minutes around the mean. During the Extended Mission, a small maneuver could be used to eliminate any further drift in LMST. The solar beta angle, which is closely related to the local solar time, had to be maintained at values less than -55 degrees to ensure that GRS radiative cooler was not exposed to the Sun. The Extended Mission orbit had several notable features. In late 2005, the LTST drifted to earlier values, which was favorable for THEMIS daytime infrared imaging. This period also coincided with a minimum in the Earth-Mars range, allowing high downlink data rates, also favorable for THEMIS. A similar favorable geometry occurs in late 2007.","funding_level":"N/A"},{"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:investigation:mission.ladee","display_name":"LADEE","display_description":"The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) was a robotic mission that, from low lunar orbit, gathered detailed information about the lunar atmosphere, conditions near the surface and environmental influences on lunar dust.

After a five-month cruise and a two-month\n    approach to Mars, MRO entered Mars' orbit on 10 March 2006 and began\n    aerobraking.  The primary science phase began on 8 November, 2006.\n \n \n  Mission Phases\n  ==============\n \n    The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Mission is divided in time into seven\n    phases: Launch, Cruise, Approach and Orbit Insertion, Aerobraking,\n    Primary Science, Extended Science, and Relay.\n \n    LAUNCH\n    ------\n      Launch extended from the start of the countdown to the initial\n      acquisition, by the DSN, of the orbiter in a safe and stable\n      configuration.\n \n      The baseline launch vehicle for the MRO mission was the Lockheed-Martin\n      Atlas V 401.  This launch vehicle was selected by NASA-KSC (Kennedy\n      Space Flight Center) via a competitive procurement under the NASA\n      Launch Services (NLS) contract.  The Atlas V 401 was a two-stage\n      launch vehicle consisting of the Atlas Common Core Booster and a\n      single engine Centaur upper stage.  The Centaur upper stage could\n      perform multiple restarts of its main engine.  For precise pointing and\n      control during coast and powered flight, the Centaur used a flight\n      control system that was 3-axis stabilized. The Atlas large payload\n      fairing was used to protect MRO during the Atlas boost phase.  This\n      fairing had a diameter of 4.2m and a length of 12.2m.\n \n      The launch and injection of MRO occured during the Mars opportunity\n      of August 2005. The Atlas booster, in combination with the Centaur\n      upper stage, delivered the MRO spacecraft into a targeted parking\n      orbit. After a short coast, a restart of the Centaur upper stage\n      injected MRO onto an interplanetary transfer trajectory.\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2005-08-12\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2005-08-12\n \n    CRUISE\n    ------\n      Duration: About five months. The cruise phase extended from DSN\n      initial acquisition, in a safe and stable configuration, until two\n      months prior to the Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI) maneuver. Primary\n      activities during cruise included spacecraft and payload checkout and\n      calibration.  These activities, along with daily monitoring of orbiter\n      subsystems, were performed in order to fully characterize the\n      performance of the spacecraft and its payload prior to arrival at\n      Mars.  In addition, standard navigation activities were performed\n      during this flight phase, the first being the largest TCM performed\n      fifteen days after launch.\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2005-08-12\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2006-01-10\n \n    APPROACH AND ORBIT INSERTION\n    ----------------------------\n      This phase extended from two months prior to Mars Orbit Insertion\n      (MOI), through MOI, and until the orbiter was checked out and ready to\n      begin aerobraking. The orbiter was inserted into a nearly polar orbit\n      with a period of 35 hours.\n \n      During the last sixty days of the interplanetary transit, spacecraft\n      and ground activities were focused on the events necessary for a\n      successful arrival and safe capture at Mars. Navigation techniques\n      included the use of delta-DOR measurements in the orbit determination.\n      This technique yielded a precise determination of the inbound\n      trajectory with a series of final TCMs used to control the flight path\n      of the spacecraft up to the MOI maneuver.\n \n      Also during the approach phase, MRO performed the Optical Navigation\n      experiment.  This involved pointing the optical navigation camera\n      (ONC) at the moons of Mars - Phobos and Deimos, and tracking their\n      motion. By comparing the observed position of the moons to their\n      predicted positions, relative to the background stars, the ground was\n      able to accurately determine the position of the orbiter.\n \n      Upon arrival at Mars on March 10, 2006, the spacecraft performed its\n      MOI maneuver using its six main engines.  MOI inserted the spacecraft\n      into an initial, highly elliptical capture orbit.  The delta-V\n      required to accomplish this critical maneuver was 1015 m/s and took\n      about 26 minutes to complete. For most of the burn, the orbiter was\n      visible from the DSN stations.  The signal was occulted as the orbiter\n      went behind Mars, and appeared again a short time later. The reference\n      MRO capture orbit had a period of 35 hours and a periapsis altitude of\n      300km.  The orientation of the ascending node was 8:30 PM LMST.  The\n      capture orbit was been selected such that aerobraking would be\n      completed prior to the start of solar conjunction (September 23,\n      2006).\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2006-01-10\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2006-03-10\n \n \n    AEROBRAKING\n    -----------\n      The Aerobraking Phase of the mission consisted of three sub-phases,\n      Aerobraking Operations, Transition to PSO Operations, and Solar\n      Conjunction.\n \n      Aerobraking Operations Sub-Phase\n      --------------------------------\n \n      One week after MOI, aerobraking operations commenced.  During this\n      time period, the orbiter used aerobraking techniques to supplement its\n      onboard propulsive capability and to reduce its orbit period to that\n      necessary for the primary science orbit (PSO).  Aerobraking Operations\n      consisted of a walk-in phase, a main phase, and a walkout phase, and\n      was followed by a transition to the PSO.  During the walk-in phase, the\n      spacecraft established initial contact with the atmosphere as the\n      periapsis altitude of the orbit was slowly lowered.  The walk-in phase\n      continued until the dynamic pressures and heating rate values required\n      for main phase, or steady state aerobraking, were established.  During\n      the main phase of aerobraking operations, large scale orbit period\n      reduction occurred as the orbiter was guided to dynamic pressure\n      limits. Main phase aerobraking continued until the orbit lifetime of\n      the orbiter reached 2 days.  (Orbit lifetime is defined as the time it\n      takes the apoapsis altitude of the orbit to decay to an altitude of\n      300km.)  When the orbit lifetime of the orbiter reached 2 days, the\n      walkout phase of aerobraking operations began.  During the walkout\n      phase, the periapsis altitude of the orbit was slowly increased as the\n      2 day orbit lifetime of the orbiter was maintained.  Once the orbit of\n      the orbiter reached an apoapsis altitude of 450km, the orbiter\n      terminated aerobraking by propulsively raising the periapsis of its\n      orbit out of the atmosphere.\n \n      Because the PSO had nodal orientation requirements, the aerobraking\n      phase of the MRO mission had to proceed in a timely manner and be\n      completed near the time the desired nodal geometry was achieved. After\n      approximately 4.5 months of aerobraking, the dynamic pressure control\n      limits were reset such that the orbiter will fly to the desired 3:00\n      pm LMST nodal target.\n \n      Transition to PSO Operations Sub-Phase\n      --------------------------------------\n \n      Once the orbit apoapsis altitude was reduced to 450 km, the orbiter\n      terminated aerobraking by raising periapsis to a safe altitude and\n      begin a transition to the Primary Science Phase.  The periapsis of\n      the transition orbit rotated around Mars from over the equatorial\n      latitudes to the North Pole.  When periapsis reached the North Pole,\n      apoapsis was reduced propulsively to 255 km and orbit rotation stopped\n      - the orbit was frozen with periapsis over the South Pole and apoapsis\n      over the North Pole.  The SHARAD antenna and the CRISM cover were\n      deployed, the instruments were checked out and remaining calibrations\n      were performed.  The payloads collected data in their normal operating\n      modes to ensure that the end-to-end data collection and processing\n      systems worked as planned.\n \n      Solar Conjuction Sub-Phase\n      --------------------------\n \n      Orbiter activities in preparation for science were then temporarily\n      suspended during a four week period surrounding solar conjunction.\n \n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2006-03-17\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2006-11-07\n \n      Aerobraking Operations Sub-Phase Start Time: 2006-03-17\n      Aerobraking Operations Sub-Phase Stop Time: 2006-09-15\n \n      Transition to PSO Operations Sub-Phase Start Time: 2006-09-15\n      Transition to PSO Operations Sub-Phase Stop Time: 2006-10-09\n \n      Solar Conjunction Sub-Phase Start Time: 2006-10-09\n      Solar Conjunction Sub-Phase Stop Time: 2006-11-07\n \n \n    PRIMARY SCIENCE\n    ---------------\n      The 255 x 320 km Primary Science Orbit (PSO) was a near-polar orbit\n      with periapsis frozen over the South Pole.  It was sun-synchronous with\n      an ascending node orientation that provided a Local Mean Solar Time\n      (LMST) of 3:00 p.m. at the equator.  Because of the eccentricity of\n      the Mars orbit around the Sun, true solar time varied by nearly 45\n      minutes over the course of one Mars year.\n \n      The Primary Science Phase of the mission began after solar conjunction\n      and after turn-on and checkout of the science instruments in the\n      Primary Science Orbit.  The phase started on 8 November 2006 and\n      extended for about one Mars year, through December 19, 2008.\n \n      The science investigations were functionally divided into daily global\n      mapping and profiling, regional survey, and globally distributed\n      targeting investigations.  The global mapping instruments were the MCS\n      and the MARCI.  The targeted investigations were HiRISE, CRISM, and\n      CTX. The survey investigations were CRISM and CTX (in survey modes),\n      and SHARAD.  The global mapping instruments required nadir pointing,\n      low data rate, and continuous or near-continuous operations.  The\n      global mapping investigations were expected to use less than 5% of the\n      expected downlink data volume.  The targeted and survey instruments\n      were high data rate instruments and required precise targeting in\n      along-track timing and/or cross-track pointing for short periods of\n      time over selected portions of the surface.  More than 95% of the\n      available downlink data volume was expected to be used for\n      targeted and survey investigations. All instruments were able to take\n      data simultaneously.\n \n      The Phoenix lander arrived at Mars on May 25, 2008. Phoenix used\n      MRO to characterize its prime landing site choices early in the\n      Primary Science Phase. MRO also provided relay support for Entry,\n      Descent, and Landing (EDL) activities and for telecommunications late\n      in the PSP after Phoenix arrived at Mars.\n      Phoenix and MRO also coordinated some observations to maximize\n      science return to the Mars Exploration Program.\n \n      NASA may approve, as resources and on-orbit capability permit,\n      continuation of science observations beyond the Primary Science Phase\n      until end of the Relay Phase (also End of Mission).  The orbiter will\n      remain in the Primary Science Orbit during the Relay Phase.\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2006-11-08\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2008-12-19\n \n \n    EXTENDED SCIENCE\n    ---------------\n      NASA approved continuation of science observations after the Primary\n      Science Phase ended. MRO operations are continuing in the Extended\n      Science Phase, which is funded for another Mars year. MRO carries\n      enough fuel to continue operating for several more years.\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2008-12-20\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2010-12-19\n \n \n    RELAY\n    -----\n      MRO provides critical relay support to missions launched as part\n      of the Mars Exploration Program after MRO.  For spacecraft launched in\n      the 2007 opportunity, this relay support occurred before the end of\n      the MRO Primary Science Phase.   Following completion of the Primary\n      and Extended Science Phases, MRO will continue to provide critical\n      relay support for Mars missions until its end of mission.\n \n      The Phoenix lander arrived at Mars on May 25, 2008. MRO provided\n      science imaging support for site characterization and selection\n      and relay support for Phoenix Entry,\n      Descent and Landing activities and for its science data return.\n      Another mission, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) was originally\n      proposed for the 2009 Mars launch opportunity but has been delayed\n      until the 2011 opportunity.  MSL will also need science imaging support\n      for site characterization and selection and relay support for EDL and\n      science data return.  The MRO Mission Plan describes the generic\n      support activities for any mission as well as current early planning\n      in support of Phoenix and MSL.\n \n      The orbiter has been designed to carry enough propellant to remain\n      operational for 5 years beyond the end-of-mission (EOM) on December\n      31, 2010 to support future MEP missions.  As this is beyond the EOM,\n      no activities have been planned for this time period.  To ensure that\n      the orbiter remains in a viable orbit during this time, its orbit\n      altitude will be increased at EOM to about 20 km inside the orbit of\n      the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft.\n \n      The MRO approach to planetary protection differs from any previous\n      Mars orbiter.  The NASA requirements for planetary protection,\n      NPG8020.12B, allow a class III mission, like MRO, to use either the\n      'probability of impact/orbit lifetime' or a 'total bio burden'\n      approach.  Implementing the Level 1 MRO requirements with the\n      instruments selected via the NASA AO requires low orbits whose\n      lifetimes are incompatible with a 'probability of impact/orbit\n      lifetime' approach to Planetary Protection.  Therefore, MRO is\n      implementing the requirements of NPG8020.12B using the 'total\n      bio-burden' approach.  This approach has been documented in the MRO\n      Planetary Protection Plan (D-23711). The details of cleaning\n      requirements are documented in the MRO Planetary Protection\n      Implementation Plan, MRO 212-11, JPL D-22688. The MRO launch targets\n      will be biased away from a direct intercept course with Mars to ensure\n      a less than 1 in 10,000 chance of the launch vehicle upper stage\n      entering Mars atmosphere.\n \n      The End-of-Mission (EOM) is planned for December 31, 2010 just prior\n      to the third solar conjunction of the mission.  The orbiter will\n      perform a propulsive maneuver to place itself in a higher orbit to\n      increase the orbit lifetime and enable extended mission operations.\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2010-12-20\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : to be determined","image_url":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/web/badge/mro.jpg"},{"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:investigation:mission.phoenix","display_name":"Phoenix","display_description":"Mission Overview\n  ================\n    The Phoenix Mission was the first Scout class mission. It consisted of a\n    single lander with associated instrumentation. Phoenix was launched on\n    August 4, 2007 and landed on the northern plains of Mars (68.22 degrees\n    N, 234.25 degrees East Areocentric) on May 25, 2008. The Lander\n    operated until November 2, 2008, performing on the Martian surface for\n    152 sols (sols are Martian days, 1 sol equaling 24.66 hours). The\n    Phoenix Mission was divided into seven phases: Development, Launch,\n    Cruise, Approach, Entry Descent and Landing (EDL), Characterization, and\n    Surface Phase. The Surface Phase constituted the primary and extended\n    missions, and focused on testing the hypothesis that water ice exists\n    beneath a thin soil cover, evaluating evidence for habitability zones,\n    and monitoring weather during the northern summer. Hence, inferring the\n    presence of water and its interaction with the Martian soil was of\n    crucial importance [SMITHETAL2008].\n \n  Mission phases\n  =============\n    Development\n    -----------\n      The Development Phase began with the start of mission funding on January\n      15, 2003. During  this phase, the science and technology requirements\n      were developed and analyzed, hardware was  constructed and tested, and\n      the spacecraft trajectory and mission operations were determined. The\n      phase was concluded on August 3, 2007 [SMITHETAL2008].\n \n      Spacecraft Id : PHX\n      Target Name : MARS\n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2003-01-15\n      Mission Phase Stop Time : 2007-08-03\n      Spacecraft Operations Type : LANDER\n \n    Launch\n    ------\n      The Phoenix Launch Phase began at the final countdown through\n      spacecraft separation from the upper stage. Phoenix was launched on\n      August 4, 2007, at 926 UTC (526 EDT) from launch complex 17A at Cape\n      Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The boost portion of the launch\n      vehicle trajectory took approximately 10 minutes, and was followed by\n      a short coast phase in a parking orbit for approximately 15 minutes.\n      After third stage burnout, the upper stage despun the stack using a\n      yo-yo despin system. Separation of the third stage occurred\n      approximately 36 minutes after launch [SMITHETAL2008].\n \n      Spacecraft Id : PHX\n      Target Name : MARS\n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2007-08-04\n      Mission Phase Stop Time : 2007-08-04\n      Spacecraft Operations Type : LANDER\n \n    Cruise\n    ------\n      The Phoenix Cruise phase began soon after separation from the third\n      stage on August 4, 2007, and ended 60 days before entry into the Mars\n      atmosphere, on March 26, 2008. The duration of the cruise phase for\n      Phoenix was approximately 236 days. During this phase, Phoenix\n      performed a number of major activities, including checkout and\n      maintenance of the spacecraft in its flight configuration, the\n      monitoring characterization and calibration of the spacecraft and\n      payload systems, software parameter updates, attitude correction\n      turns, navigation activities for determining and correcting the\n      vehicle's flight path, and preparation for EDL and surface operations,\n      including EDL X-band communication tests. No science investigations\n      were conducted during the cruise phase, excepting instrument health\n      checkouts [SMITHETAL2008].\n \n      Spacecraft Id : PHX\n      Target Name : MARS\n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2007-08-04\n      Mission Phase Stop Time : 2008-03-26\n      Spacecraft Operations Type : LANDER\n \n    Approach\n    --------\n      The Approach Phase began on March 26, 2008, 60 days before entry into\n      the Martian atmosphere. This phase was dedicated to the activities\n      necessary to ensure a successful EDL for the spacecraft, which\n      included: acquisition and processing of navigation data to support\n      development of the final trajectory correction maneuvers, and\n      activities leading up to the final turn to the entry attitude and\n      separation from the cruise stage seven minutes before entry. The\n      Approach Phase ended at the atmospheric entry interface point 125 km\n      from the surface of Mars, on May 25, 2008  [SMITHETAL2008].\n \n      Spacecraft Id : PHX\n      Target Name : MARS\n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2008-03-26\n      Mission Phase Stop Time : 2008-05-25\n      Spacecraft Operations Type : LANDER\n \n    Entry, Descent, and Landing\n    ---------------------------\n      The EDL phase began immediately following entry into the Martian\n      atmosphere on May 25, 2008, and lasted seven minutes from entry to\n      touchdown. This phase was broken into hypersonic, parachute, and\n      terminal descent subphases, all of which required the spacecraft to be\n      in a different configuration. Terminal descent on Phoenix was\n      accomplished using a pulsed propulsion system, based on the Mars\n      Polar Lander (MPL).\n \n      Communications throughout the EDL phase - spanning cruise stage\n      separation through landing plus one minute - were accomplished via\n      UHF relay between Phoenix and the orbiters Mars Odyssey (ODY), Mars\n      Express (MEX), and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). All X-band\n      capability was lost once the cruise stage was jettisoned. During most\n      of EDL, Phoenix used a UHF antenna that wrapped around the backshell\n      to give the Lander a wide field of view (FOV) for communications,\n      which provided the wide spread of off-boresight angles necessitated\n      by the geometry between Phoenix and  the orbiters. During terminal\n      descent (approximately 30 seconds before landing), the Lander switched\n      to the landed Helix antenna and continued transmitting a UHF signal\n      until one minute after landing.\n \n      After waiting 20 minutes after touchdown for the dust to settle,\n      Phoenix began performing a number of critical activities. These 'sol\n      0' activities included deployments of the landed solar arrays, the\n      bio-barrier covering the RA, and the SSI and MET masts. The Stereo\n      Surface Imager (SSI) took images of the bio-barrier, solar arrays,\n      and part of the footpad and workspace. High priority EDL and sol 0\n      data were saved to flash memory within the first hour after touchdown,\n      after which the Lander went to sleep to conserve energy. The Lander\n      woke up for ten minutes for the first post-landed UHF communication\n      pass one MRO orbit period (approximately 2 hours) after landing. After\n      relaying data to the orbiter during that first pass, the Lander went\n      to sleep again. Payload heaters were on continuously from touchdown,\n      with Lander heaters kicking in around midnight for 4-5 hours of keep-\n      alive heating [DESAIETAL2008].\n \n      Spacecraft Id : PHX\n      Target Name : MARS\n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2008-05-25\n      Mission Phase Stop Time : 2008-05-25\n      Spacecraft Operations Type : LANDER\n \n    Characterization\n    ----------------\n      The Characterization Phase began after the sol 0 activities were\n      completed and lasted for eight  Martian sols. During this phase the\n      lander's power, thermal and UHF subsystems were characterized and\n      prepared for operation. The Robotic Arm (RA) system, Surface Stereo\n      Imager (SSI), Microscopy, Electrochemistry, Conductivity Analyzer\n      (MECA), Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA), and Meteorological\n      Station (MET) instruments were also characterized and prepared. Data\n      collected on sol 0 were relayed to the ground, and the SSI imaged the\n      lander and the surrounding environment. The Robotic Arm was unstowed\n      and completed several practice sample transfers to prepare the Lander\n      equipment for the primary mission [SMITHETAL2008].\n \n      Spacecraft Id : PHX\n      Target Name : MARS\n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2008-05-26\n      Mission Phase Stop Time : 2008-06-05\n      Spacecraft Operations Type : LANDER\n \n    Primary Mission (Surface Phase)\n    -------------------------------\n      The SSI provided high-resolution, stereo, and panoramic images\n      throughout the Phoenix Mission. The SSI served a variety of purposes,\n      including surveying the local geomorphology of the landing site,\n      providing range coordinates for digging operations, and making\n      atmospheric dust and cloud measurements. The SSI included two cameras\n      that allowed for the capture of three-dimensional views of the\n      landing site. Multispectral filters enabled imaging at 12 wavelengths\n      (0.4 to 1.0 micrometers) of geological and atmospheric phenomena\n      [LEMMONETAL2008].\n \n      The Robotic Arm (RA) was successfully deployed and declared operational\n      on sol 1 and operated through sol 149. A detailed map of the\n      surrounding local geomorphology provided by the SSI allowed for the\n      specification of range coordinates to the RA for digging operations.\n      The RA and the associated Icy Soil Acquisition Device (ISAD)\n      excavated and delivered samples to the Microscopy, Electrochemistry,\n      and Conductivity Analyzer (MECA) and the Thermal Evolved Gas Analyzer\n      (TEGA). The Robotic Arm Camera (RAC) was attached above the RA scoop\n      and provided close-up, full-color images of various objects of\n      interest in the area immediately surrounding the lander, including\n      prospective soil and water ice samples in trenches dug by the RA,\n      verification of collected samples in the scoop prior to analysis by\n      MECA and TEGA, and the floor and side-walls of the trench to examine\n      fine-scale texturing and layering [KELLERETAL2008].\n \n      MECA was responsible for the analysis of soil samples in accordance\n      with the Surface Mission objectives, and consisted of onboard\n      instruments such as the Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL), Optical\n      Microscopy (OM)/Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and the Thermal and\n      Electrical Conductivity Probe (TECP).\n \n      WCL performed chemical analyses on three Martian soil samples. One\n      soil sample was obtained from the top ~2 cm of soil and two were\n      obtained at ~5 cm depth from the icy soil interface. When mixed with\n      water in a ~1.25 soil to solution ratio (by volume), a portion of the\n      soil components solvated. Ion concentrations were measured using an\n      array of ion selective electrodes. Solution conductivity was measured\n      using a conductivity cell [KOUNAVESETAL2009].\n \n      Nine soil samples were successfully delivered to the OM/AFM for\n      detailed microscopic examination [SMITHETAL2009].\n \n      The TECP was located on the RA and measured the temperature, thermal\n      conductivity, and volumetric heat capacity of the soil. It also\n      detected and quantified the population of mobile H2O molecules in the\n      soil, by measuring the electrical conductivity as well as the\n      dielectric permittivity. TECP measured atmospheric H2O vapor\n      abundance and augmented the wind velocity measurements from the\n      meteorology instrumentation. TECP was mounted near the end of the RA\n      and could be placed either in the soil or held aloft in the\n      atmosphere [ZENTETAL2009].\n \n      TEGA consisted of two separate components: a Differential Scanning\n      Calorimeter (DSC) and an Evolved Gas Analyzer (EGA) and was a\n      derivative of the instrument flown on the Mars Polar Lander\n      [BOYNTONETAL2009]. Samples delivered to TEGA by the RA were heated in\n      ovens to temperatures up to 950 deg C. Water and carbon dioxide\n      released during the heating were analyzed in the EGA. The power\n      required by the sample oven was continuously monitored during the\n      heating and compared to that required to heat a similar, but empty,\n      oven. The power difference was the output of the DSC. Both\n      endothermic and exothermic phase transitions could be detected, and\n      were used to identify the phases present. By correlating the gas\n      release with the calorimetry, the abundance of the volatile compounds\n      associated with the different phases was determined [SMITHETAL2009],\n      [BOYNTONETAL2009].\n \n      A dozen trenches were excavated at the Phoenix landing site and 31\n      samples were acquired for delivery to instruments on the Lander: six\n      to WCL, nine to OM/AFM, and seven to TEGA. Several rocks were also\n      moved to examine the underlying material. Samples delivered to TEGA,\n      OM/AFM, and WCL revealed that the Martian soil consists of an\n      approximately 3 cm deep surface layer of cloddy material above an\n      underlying icy soil substrate. Soil samples deposited via the sprinkle\n      technique indicated that the soil clods were weakly cohesive\n      [ARVIDSONETAL2009], [SMITHETAL2009].\n \n      The Meteorological Package (MET) consisted of three temperature\n      sensors, one pressure sensor, and the lidar system. Temperature was\n      measured by three temperature sensors fixed to the weather station\n      mast. These sensors measured temperature by monitoring its effect on\n      an electrical current through a closed circuit. Pressure was\n      monitored throughout each sol by a pressure sensor located on the\n      deck of the lander [TAYLORETAL2008].\n \n      The lidar system measured the height profile of backscattered laser\n      light from airborne dust and clouds. The system consisted of a\n      rapid-pulse laser and an optical telescope. The lidar's laser shot\n      rapid pulses of light into the atmosphere, which were reflected off\n      airborne particles back to the optical telescope, allowing the\n      composition, movement, and size of clouds and particles above the\n      lander to be determined. These data were coordinated with solar\n      radiation measurements and in situ sampling to study the climate and\n      the water cycle [WHITEWAYETAL2008]. The SSI also captured movies of\n      the Telltale wind indicator, providing additional information on wind\n      velocity and direction [MOORESETAL2010].\n \n      Spacecraft Id : PHX\n      Target Name : MARS\n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2008-06-05\n      Mission Phase Stop Time : 2008-11-02\n      Spacecraft Operations Type : LANDER","image_url":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/web/badge/phoenix.png"},{"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:investigation:mission.mars_science_laboratory","display_name":"Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity)","display_description":"Mission Overview\n  ================\n    Development of the Mars Science Laboratory project began in 2003.  On\n    November 26 2011, the Mars Science Laboratory mission launched a\n    spacecraft on a trajectory to Mars, and on August 6, 2012 (UTC), it\n    landed a mobile science vehicle named Curiosity at a landing site in\n    Gale Crater.  During the trip to Mars, instrument health checks were\n    performed and the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument\n    collected science data.  For the primary mission on the surface of\n    Mars (ending September 28, 2014), the rover explored the landing site\n    and gathered imaging, spectroscopy, composition data, and other\n    measurements for selected Martian soils, rocks, and the atmosphere.\n    These data will allow the science team to quantitatively assess the\n    habitability and environmental history.  The prime mission's science\n    objectives were to assess the biological potential of the landing site,\n    characterize the geology of the landing region, investigate planetary\n    processes that influence habitability, and characterize the broad\n    spectrum of surface radiation.  The first extended mission retains all\n    of the prime mission's objectives and will also strive to: identify and\n    quantitatively assess the subset of habitable environments that are\n    also capable of preserving organic compounds, and explore and\n    characterize major environmental transitions recorded in the geology of\n    the foothills of Mt. Sharp and adjacent plains.\n \n    The science instruments, with an acronym or abbreviation and Principal\n    Investigator (PI) are listed below:\n \n    Science Instrument                                 PI\n    -------------------------------------------------  --------------------\n    Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS)           Ralf Gellert\n    Chemical Camera (ChemCam)                          Roger Wiens\n    Chemistry & Mineralogy (CheMin)                    David Blake\n    Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN)                   Igor Mitrofanov\n    Mast Camera (Mastcam)                              Michael Malin\n    Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI)                      Kenneth Edgett\n    Mars Descent Imager (MARDI)                        Michael Malin\n    Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD)                Don Hassler\n    Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS)      Javier Gomez-Elvira\n    Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM)                      Paul Mahaffy\n \n \n  Mission Phases\n  ==============\n    The Mars Science Laboratory Mission is divided in time into six phases:\n    (1) Development; (2) Launch; (3) Cruise and Approach; (4) Entry,\n    Descent, and Landing (EDL); (5) Primary Surface Mission; and (6)\n    Extended Surface Mission.\n \n \n    DEVELOPMENT\n    -----------\n      Development of the Mars Science Laboratory mission began in October\n      2003 with concept and technology development, followed by preliminary\n      design and technology development completion from March 2006 through\n      September 2006, final design and fabrication from September 2006\n      through January 2008, and system assembly, integration, and test from\n      late January 2008 until launch on November 26, 2011.\n \n      Spacecraft Id : MSL\n      Target Name : MARS\n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2003-10-01\n      Mission Phase Stop Time : 2011-11-26\n      Spacecraft Operations Type : ROVER\n \n \n    LAUNCH\n    ------\n      The launch phase began when the spacecraft switched to internal power\n      prior to launch and ended when the spacecraft reached a thermally\n      stable commandable configuration after separation from the launch\n      vehicle upper stage.  MSL was launched on an ATLAS V 541 launch vehicle\n      on November 26 2011 at 15:02 UTC (10:02 EST) from Cape Canaveral Air\n      Force Station, Florida.\n \n      Spacecraft Id : MSL\n      Target Name : MARS\n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2011-11-26\n      Mission Phase Stop Time : 2011-11-26\n      Spacecraft Operations Type : ROVER\n \n \n    CRUISE AND APPROACH\n    -------------------\n      The cruise and approach phase began when the launch phase ended, and\n      ended 30 minutes prior to entry into the Mars atmosphere.  The MSL\n      spacecraft used a ballistic Type 1 interplanetary transfer during\n      cruise from Earth to Mars. The major activities during cruise included:\n      checkout and maintenance of the spacecraft in its flight configuration;\n      monitoring, characterization, and calibration of the spacecraft and\n      payload systems; software parameter updates; attitude correction turns;\n      navigation activities for determining and correcting the vehicle's\n      flight path; and preparation for EDL and surface operations. Three\n      Trajectory Correction Maneuvers (TCMs) were conducted during cruise.\n      The only science investigation during cruise was radiation monitoring\n      by the RAD instrument.\n \n      Approach began 45 days before entry into the Martian atmosphere and\n      ended 30 minutes before entry. During approach, the focus of\n      operations was primarily on navigation activities (including a fourth\n      and final TCM eight days before landing), and preparation for entry,\n      descent, and landing.\n \n      Spacecraft Id : MSL\n      Target Name : MARS\n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2011-11-26\n      Mission Phase Stop Time : 2012-08-06\n      Spacecraft Operations Type : ROVER\n \n \n    ENTRY, DESCENT, AND LANDING\n    ---------------------------\n      The entry, descent, and landing (EDL) phase began when the Cruise and\n      Approach Phase was over (30 minutes before atmospheric entry), and\n      ended when the rover reached a thermally stable, positive energy\n      balance, commandable configuration on the surface of Mars. During this\n      phase, a series of events was self-triggered on the spacecraft. Before\n      entry, the thermal loop was vented and the cruise stage was\n      jettisoned. The entry vehicle, consisting of the backshell, heat\n      shield, descent stage, and rover, performed a series of guided\n      maneuvers. Cruise balance masses separated to adjust the center of\n      mass of the entry vehicle. At 3522.2 km from the center of Mars, the\n      vehicle entered the atmosphere. This was followed by peak heating,\n      peak deceleration, supersonic parachute deploy, and heat shield\n      separation. At the appropriate time, the descent stage engines\n      started, the backshell and parachute separated, and the MARs Descent\n      Imager (MARDI) started recording video. As the descent stage\n      approached the surface using powered descent, at an altitude of about\n      18.6 m, the rover was lowered on a descent rate limiter and bridle\n      umbilical device to 7.5 m below the descent stage, and its wheels were\n      deployed into the touchdown configuration. The descent stage continued\n      descending until the rover touched down on the surface of Mars. The\n      rover landed in Gale Crater at the latitude of 4.5895 degrees South,\n      and longitude of 137.4417 degrees East, in late southern winter (Solar\n      Longitude L=150.7), at 15:03 Local Mean Solar Time on Mars (August 6,\n      2012, 05:18 UTC Spacecraft Event Time).  Upon successful touchdown,\n      the descent rate limiter and bridle umbilical device were cut. The\n      descent stage flew away and impacted the surface 650 meters away from\n      the rover.\n \n      Spacecraft Id : MSL\n      Target Name : MARS\n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2012-08-06\n      Mission Phase Stop Time : 2012-08-06\n      Spacecraft Operations Type : ROVER\n \n \n    PRIMARY SURFACE MISSION\n    -----------------------\n      The surface phase began when the EDL phase ended and will end when the\n      mission is declared complete.  The flight mission was designed to\n      provide for a surface mission phase duration of at least one Mars year\n      (687 days, or 669 sols).\n \n      Following touchdown, a combination of automated rover sequences and\n      planned checkouts was executed in order to bring the rover up to a\n      basic level of functionality and to verify that the rover systems and\n      payload were all operating as expected.  A surface initial checkout\n      period was defined as starting at successful rover touchdown on Mars\n      with descent stage separation/fly-away, and concluded with a\n      transition to normal tactical operations.\n \n      Originally, the prime mission was expected to last through Sol 670 but\n      the project was given an extension of about 3 months, in order to sync\n      up the beginning of its 1st Extended Mission with the NASA fiscal year.\n \n      Spacecraft Id : MSL\n      Target Name : MARS\n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2012-08-06\n      Mission Phase Stop Time : 2014-09-28\n      Spacecraft Operations Type : ROVER\n \n \n    EXTENDED SURFACE MISSION\n    ------------------------\n      The extended surface phase began on Sol 764.\n \n      Spacecraft Id : MSL\n      Target Name : MARS\n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2014-09-29\n      Mission Phase Stop Time : UNK\n      Spacecraft Operations Type : ROVER","image_url":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/web/badge/msl.png"},{"image_url":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/web/badge/insight.png","logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:investigation:mission.insight","display_name":"InSight","display_description":"The InSight mission will place a lander on Mars that will deploy a seismometer and a heat-flow probe, along with cameras, a magnetometer, a meteorology experiment, and a radio science experiment.","funding_level":"Discovery"},{"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:investigation:mission.lunar_prospector","display_name":"LUNAR PROSPECTOR","display_description":"Mission Overview\n================\n \nThe Lunar Prospector (LP) Mission consisted of a spin-stablized\norbiter spacecraft designed to perform continuous mapping of the Moon\nfrom a circular polar orbit.  LP was selected as the third mission in\nNASA's Discovery program in February, 1995.  The spacecraft was\ndesigned and built in about 2 years by Lockheed Martin Missiles and\nSpace in Sunnyvale, CA.  It was delivered for launch in late 1997\n[BINDERETAL1998].  The LP spacecraft was launched on January 7, 1998\n(UTC).  The primary mapping mission began on January 16, 1998 and\nlasted for one year.  During most of the mapping mission, the\nspacecraft mapped the surface from a 118-minute, circular, polar orbit\n100 km above the moon's surface [BINDER1998].  Starting on 12/19/98\nthe spacecraft was maneuvered into a 40 km orbit as a transition into\na low altitude extended mission orbit.  The transition orbit was used\nto collect gravity data in order to verify the moon's gravity model in\npreparation for conducting the extended mission orbit.\n \nThe extended mission began on January 16, 1999.  The objective of the\nextended mission was to provide higher resolution mapping from a\ncircular, polar orbit averaging 30 km above the moon's surface.  The\nspacecraft was maneuvered in its 30 km extended mission orbit starting\non January 29, 1999.  The Lunar Prospector mission ended on July 31,\n1999 when the spacecraft was intentionally impacted into a crater near\nthe south pole.  The impact site was targeted for one of the hydrogen\ndeposits detected by Lunar Prospector's Neutron Spectrometer.  The\nintent of the impact event was to generate a plume of dust and vapor\nfrom the deposit to try to confirm the presence of water through a\nseries of earth-based and space-based spectral observations.  The\nimpact of Lunar Prospector occurred at 9:52 UTC on July 31, 1999.\nThere was no evidence of a dust plume, a water vapor plume, or an OH\nplume.\n \nThe science goals of the Lunar Prospector Mission were to map the\nMoon's surface composition and its magnetic and gravity fields, and to\ndetermine the frequency and location of gas release events.  Special\nemphasis was placed of the search for polar ice deposits.\n \nTo meet these science goals the LP spacecraft carried five science\ninstruments mounted on three booms.  The instrument package included a\nGamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), a Neutron Spectrometer (NS), an Alpha\nParticle Spectrometer (APS), a Magnetometer (MAG), and an Electron\nReflectometer (ER).  A sixth science investigation was a Doppler\nGravity Experiment (DGE) that used tracking data for mapping the\ngravity field.  The gravity data was derived from tracking the LP\nspacecraft with the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) with ground stations\nin California, Spain, and Australia [KONOPLIVETAL1998].\n \nThe LP science team consisted of the PI, Alan Binder, and five Co-I's,\nand was divided into three groups.  The Spectrometer Group consisted\nof William Feldman and Binder.  The Magnetics Group consisted of\nRobert Lin, Mario Acuna, and Lon Hood.  The Gravity Group consisted of\nAlexander Konopliv.\n \nMission Phases\n==============\n \nLUNAR PROSPECTOR LAUNCH\n-----------------------\n \nThe Lunar Prospector spacecraft was launched on January 7, 1998 at\n2:28:44 UTC on a Lockheed Martin Launch Vehicle 2 (Athena 2) from the\nSpaceport Florida commercial pad (Pad 46) at Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nAfter about 1/2 of an orbit around the Earth, a 64 second burn by the\nspacecraft's Trans Lunar Injection stage sent LP on a 105 hour cruise\nto the moon.  The spacecraft was turned on at 56.5 minutes after\nlaunch.\n \n         Spacecraft Id:                 : LP\n         Target Name                    : MOON\n         Mission Phase Start Time       : 1998-01-07\n         Mission Phase Stop Time        : 1998-01-07\n         Spacecraft Operations Type     : ORBITER\n \nLUNAR PROSPECTOR CRUISE\n-----------------------\n \nThe Lunar Prospector spacecraft was inserted into a translunar\ntrajectory after reaching a parking orbit around Earth.  The Cruise\nPhase to the moon lasted about 105 hours.  The three spacecraft booms\nwere deployed starting about 5 hours after launch.  All five science\ninstruments were turned on during cruise and collected science data\nfor instrument check out and calibration.  The MAG/ER was activated at\nabout 1.33 hours after launch and the APS at about 3.5 hours after\nlaunch.  The GRS and NS needed to degas and were not turned until\nabout 24 hours after launch.  Two trajectory correction maneuvers were\nperformed during the Cruise Phase.\n \n         Spacecraft Id:                 : LP\n         Target Name                    : MOON\n         Mission Phase Start Time       : 1998-01-07\n         Mission Phase Stop Time        : 1998-01-11\n         Spacecraft Operations Type     : ORBITER\n \nLUNAR PROSPECTOR ORBIT INSERTION\n--------------------------------\n \nThe Lunar Prospector spacecraft was inserted into orbit by an initial\nLunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) engine burn at 11:45 UTC on January 11,\n1999.  The initial capture orbit had a 11.8 hour period.  Three\nadditional engine firings put the spacecraft into its mapping orbit,\nwhich was a 100 +/- 20 km circular polar orbit with a 118 minute\nperiod.  All five science instruments were operating and collecting\ndata during the Orbit Insertion Phase.\n \n         Spacecraft Id:                 : LP\n         Target Name                    : MOON\n         Mission Phase Start Time       : 1998-01-11\n         Mission Phase Stop Time        : 1998-01-16\n         Spacecraft Operations Type     : ORBITER\n \nLUNAR PROSPECTOR PRIMARY MISSION\n--------------------------------\n \nThe Lunar Prospector Primary Mission lasted for one year as originally\nplanned.  The nominal mapping orbit during the Primary Mission had an\naltitude of 100 km above the moon's surface.  Orbit maintenance\nmaneuvers were required every 56 days to correct for changes in the\nmapping orbit due to lunar gravity anomalies.\n \nThe basic mapping strategy during the Primary Mission was for the\nscience instruments to collect data continuously.  The data were\ndownlinked to Earth immediately and simultaneously transferred to a\nsolid state recorder and then downlinked 53 minutes later.  These\ndelayed data frames were interleaved into the real-time data stream.\nThe purpose of the delayed stream was to receive data acquired on the\nlunar farside when communications with the Earth were blocked by the\nmoon.  Late in the Primary Mission as the spacecraft batteries began\nto degrade and eclipses limited recharge time by the solar panels, the\nspacecraft transmitter was cycled off and on to conserve power.  The\ntransmitter was switched off when the spacecraft was on the lunar\nfarside and communications with the Earth were not possible.  This\ntransmitter cycling began on September 16, 1998 and continued\nperiodically throughout the rest of the Primary Mission and into the\nExtended Mission.\n \nAt the start of the Primary Mission the LP spacecraft attitude as\nmeasured by the spin axis direction (+Z, which is perpendicular to the\ntop of the spacecraft bus and in the direction of the omni antenna)\nwas pointed to within a few degrees of north ecliptic pole.  In\nOctober 1998, the spacecraft orientation was flipped by 180 degrees so\nthat the spin axis pointed toward the south ecliptic pole.  The\nreorientation was done so that the APS instrument could collect data\nthat it missed due to an anomaly on one of its faces and to test for\nany asymmetries in the response of the other spectrometers.  The\nmaneuver was initiated on October 5, 1998 with the spacecraft turning\n90 degrees (spin axis parallel to the ecliptic).  This intermediate\norientation provided calibration data for the GRS instrument.  On\nOctober 7, 1998, the spacecraft turned the final 90 degrees.  The\nspacecraft maintained the ecliptic south orientation for the rest of\nthe mission except for special procedures.  On November 15, 1998, the\nspacecraft was turned by 80 degrees to avoid possible damage to the\nsolar panels due to dust from Leonids meteor shower.  This orientation\nminimized the cross sectional area of the solar panels in the\ndirection of the shower.  On November 19, 1998, the spacecraft was\nturned back to the attitude with the spin axis nearly parallel to the\necliptic south pole.  There was no apparent damage to the spacecraft\nfrom the shower.\n \n         Spacecraft Id:                 : LP\n         Target Name                    : MOON\n         Mission Phase Start Time       : 1998-01-16\n         Mission Phase Stop Time        : 1999-01-16\n         Spacecraft Operations Type     : ORBITER\n \nLUNAR PROSPECTOR EXTENDED MISSION\n--------------------------------\n \nThe Lunar Prospector Extended Mission started on January 16, 1999 and\ncontinued until July 31, 1999.  The nominal mapping orbit during the\nExtended Mission had an average altitude of 30 km above the moon's\nsurface.\n \nNear the start of the Extended Mission, noise in the Alpha Particle\nSpectrometer instrument started to affect the Neutron Spectrometer\ncausing the NS instrument to saturate.  As a result, the APS was\nturned off on February 8, 1999 to allow the NS to collect clean data.\nThe APS instrument was turned on again on April 21, 1999 and was\ncollecting good data without noise.  However, noise from the APS again\nbegan affecting the NS in mid-May 1999.  As a result, the APS was\nturned off on May 24, 1999 and it remained off for the remainder of\nthe mission.\n \nDuring the final week of the Lunar Prospector mission a number of\nevents took place in preparation for the final impact event.  On July\n26, 1999, a small orbit correction maneuver raised periselene up about\n5 km to maintain the spacecraft's circular orbit.  In preparation for\na lunar eclipse on July 28, 1999 where the spacecraft could not fully\nrecharge the battery between nighttime passes, all non-critical\nsubsystems were turned off.  The three spectrometer instruments were\npowered off before the eclipse and they remained off for the last\nthree days of the mission.  On July 29, 1999, the spacecraft was spun\nup to 23.7 rpm (from the nominal 12 rpm).  This was in preparation for\nlater maneuvers that targeted the spacecraft for impact.  On July 30,\n1999 aposelene was raised to put the spacecraft into a more elliptical\norbit.  This was done so that the impact approach was as steep (about\n6.3 deg) as possible to hit the crater floor.  On July 31, the final\nmaneuver occurred to lower periselene beneath the lunar surface such\nthat the spacecraft impacted the target point of -87.7 deg latitude,\n42 deg longitude.  The impact occurred at 09:52 UTC.\n \n         Spacecraft Id:                 : LP\n         Target Name                    : MOON\n         Mission Phase Start Time       : 1999-01-16\n         Mission Phase Stop Time        : 1999-07-31\n         Spacecraft Operations Type     : ORBITER","funding_level":"Flagship","image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Lunar_Prospector_insignia.png/160px-Lunar_Prospector_insignia.png"},{"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:investigation:mission.lunar_reconnaissance_orbiter","display_name":"Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)","display_description":"The majority of the text in this file was extracted and/or modified\n    from:\n \n    1.

Bistatic Radar Observations of the Moon Using The Arecibo Observatory &\n    Mini-RF Instrument on LRO, D.B.J. Bussey et al, presentation, 43rd Lunar\n    and Planetary Conference, March 20, 2012.\n \n    LRO was launched on June 18, 2009 on an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle\n    (EELV). The EELV inserted the orbiter into a direct trajectory to the\n    Moon. The orbiter used the on-board propulsion system to enter\n    into lunar orbit. After orbiter commissioning, the orbiter entered\n    the nominal mission orbit of 50 km. LRO will perform routine measurement\n    operations for one year. After one year, LRO may continue operations as\n    part of an extended mission operations phase. The duration of extended\n    mission is dependent on the orbit. After LRO uses all of the onboard\n    fuel, LRO's orbit will degrade and eventually impact the surface of the\n    Moon.\n \n    The orbiter carried a secondary payload, the Lunar Crater Observation\n    and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), which operated as a separate mission to\n    observe the impact of a spent Centaur rocket released over the Moon's\n    south pole. (Data from the LCROSS mission are archived separately in\n    PDS.)\n \n    Once LRO was in the final mission orbit, the six instruments began\n    to collect measurement data for the mission.  A technology\n    demonstration instrument, the Miniature-Radio Frequency (Mini-RF)\n    instrument, also collected data during the nominal mission. At the start\n    of the science mission, the status of Mini-RF was changed from\n    technology demonstration instrument to science instrument. Mini-RF ceased\n    acquiring monostatic radar data in December 2010 due to transmitter\n    failure and in 2011 began acquiring bistatic radar measurements.\n \n    Radio Science on LRO, while not a formal investigation, includes the\n    S-band communication and tracking system, the spacecraft timing system,\n    as well as Laser Ranging, a technology demonstration component.  Data\n    are collected using various elements of the Mission Operations Center\n    and the LOLA SOC.  While the primary function of the radio subsystem is\n    to support commanding, telemetry and tracking, the data are also\n    scientifically useful.  Range and Doppler data from S-band tracking at\n    a worldwide station network aids in refining lunar gravity models as\n    well as positioning the spacecraft.  Laser ranging data, which improve\n    the precision of orbit determination, in turn improve the accuracy of\n    topographic measurement.\n \n    A description of the LRO instruments follows:\n \n    1. Cosmic Ray Telescope for Effects of Radiation (CRaTER): Harlan Spence\n    leads the CRaTER measurement investigation from Boston University (BU).\n    The CRaTER instrument measures cosmic ray sources from two different\n    directions (looking nadir and zenith). The instrument telescope contains\n    a series of five detectors spaced apart that measure the different\n    cosmic rays. CRaTER measurement goals are to:\n \n    a. Measure and characterize the deep space radiation environment and\n       spectra of galactic and solar cosmic rays.\n    b. Characterize the biological impacts from the radiation environment.\n \n    CRaTER measures the Linear Energy Transfer (LET) spectra behind tissue\n    equivalent material. LET spectra are the missing link connecting both\n    Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) to\n    potential damage to tissue. CRaTER measures low LET from 200 keV to 100\n    MeV and high LET from 2 MeV to 1 GeV.\n \n    The CRaTER instrument has both a nadir and zenith field of view. The\n    zenith field of view measures the primary sources of GCRs and SEPs. The\n    nadir field of view measures sources of radiation from the lunar\n    surface.\n \n    The instrument operates continuously during the entire orbit and\n    operates autonomously. CRaTER nominally generates ~0.5 kbps of data\n    but when solar flares are detected, the data rate can increase to ~90\n    kbps.\n \n    2. Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE): David Paige leads the\n    Diviner measurement investigation from the University of California,\n    Los Angeles (UCLA). Diviner includes a 9-channel radiometer  with a\n    wavelength range from 0.3 to 200 microns. DLRE makes precise\n    radiometric temperature measurements of the lunar surface with the\n    following measurement goals:\n \n    a. Map global day/night surface temperatures.\n    b. Characterize thermal environments for habitability.\n    c. Determine rock abundances at landing sites.\n    d. Identify potential polar ice reservoirs.\n    e. Search for near-surface and exposed ice deposits.\n \n    DLRE is a 9-channel radiometer that measures wavelengths from 0.3 to\n    200 micron. Measurements have a spatial resolution of less than 500\n    m at the 50 km altitude.\n \n    DLRE operates continuously during the entire orbit. During most of the\n    orbit, the instrument looks at nadir, but the instrument has two gimbals\n    which allows it to rotate about both axes. Periodically throughout the\n    orbit, the instrument rotates to perform two types of calibration\n    activities. The first is a deep space/internal black body calibration.\n    The instrument rotates to either deep space or the internal black body\n    target for approximately 32 seconds. The deep space/black body\n    calibration is performed approximately 12 times per orbit. The second\n    calibration activity is the solar calibration activity. The instrument\n    has a solar calibration target located just below the main instrument\n    drum. During each orbit, the instrument rotates so that the solar\n    target is illuminated by the Sun. The solar and the deep space/internal\n    black body calibrations are both triggered by onboard event tables. The\n    event tables are uplinked periodically throughout each month.\n \n    DLRE collects approximately 3.5 Gbits of data each day. Besides the\n    periodic uplink of new event tables, the instrument operates\n    autonomously throughout the orbit. There may be a possibility of\n    interference with LROC imaging if a DLRE calibration sequence occurs\n    during LROC NAC imaging. DLRE can execute a freeze command that will\n    prevent a calibration sequence from occurring. The freeze command is\n    inserted just prior to the LROC image commands as part of the spacecraft\n    daily command load.\n \n    3. Lyman-Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP): Alan Stern leads the LAMP\n    measurement investigation from Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). The\n    LAMP instrument includes high and low power supplies and a double delay\n    line detector. The LAMP instrument measurement goals are to:\n \n    a. Provide landform mapping from Lyman-alpha albedos at sub-km resolution\n       in and around the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar surface.\n    b. Identify and localize exposed water frost.\n    c. Demonstrate the feasibility of using starlight and sky-glow for future\n       surface mission applications.\n \n    LAMP measurements provide additional characteristics on landing sites as\n    well as aid in the search for localized exposed water ice. The LAMP\n    instrument's sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) absorption near 1600\n    angstrom allows detection of water frost. LAMP also provides images of\n    permanently shadowed regions at ~500 m resolution.\n \n    The LAMP instrument is powered during the entire lunar orbit, but only\n    collects measurement data over the night portion of the orbit. The LAMP\n    instrument incorporates a Lunar Terminator Sensor (LTS) that detect the\n    terminator line. The LTS contains two sensor channels with each channel\n    offset from the LAMP boresight by +/- 1.5 degrees in a plane that\n    contains the spacecraft 'in-track' motion (i.e. parallel to the LAMP\n    entrance slit  width). When the instrument is approaching the terminator\n    line, the instrument high voltages are reduced when passing from dark\n    to light to prevent the detector from saturating during the dayside\n    portion of the  orbit. The LTS also signals the instrument when the\n    terminator (light to dark) is passed and the high voltages are then\n    increased for measurement data collection. In case of an LTS failure,\n    the ground generates a terminator prediction product that will be used\n    to trigger the high  voltage operations from the daily command load.\n \n    The LAMP main door has a small hole which allows it to operate over the\n    sunlit portion of the orbit. In this mode, the LTS provides the\n    software with the signal to open and close the door. When LAMP operates\n    over the entire orbit, the data volume per day is doubled to\n    approximately 2.14 Gbits.\n \n    LAMP routinely collects approximately 1 Gbit of data per day and\n    operates autonomously throughout the orbit without any daily operations\n    input.\n \n    4. Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND): The LEND measurement\n    investigation is led by Igor Mitrofanov from the Russian Institute for\n    Space Research. The LEND instrument includes a collimated sensor and\n    sensors to detect thermal, epithermal, and high-energy neutrons.\n \n    LEND objectives include:\n \n    a. Creation of high-resolution hydrogen distribution maps with\n       sensitivity of about 100 ppm of hydrogen weight and horizontal\n       spatial resolution of 5 km.\n    b. Characterization of surface distribution and column density of\n       possible near-surface water ice deposits at the Moon's polar cold\n       traps.\n    c. Creation of a global model of neutron component of space radiation at\n       an altitude of 30-50 km above the surface with spatial resolution of\n       20-50 km at the spectral range from thermal energies up to 15 MeV.\n \n    LEND sensors STN1, STN2, STN3, and SETN detect thermal neutrons and\n    epithermal neutrons to characterize the lunar radiation environment.\n    Sensors STN1 and STN3 operate as a Doppler filter for thermal neutrons\n    from the front side and back side of the instrument. Sensors SETN and\n    STN2 have open fields of view. Sensor SHEN detects high energy neutrons\n    at 16 energy channels from 300 keV to more than 15 MeV to characterize\n    the lunar radiation environment. The SHEN sensor has a narrow field of\n    view of about 20-30 degrees. LEND collimated sensors CSETN1-4 detect\n    epithermal neutrons with high angular resolution to characterize\n    spatial variations of lunar neutron albedo, which depend on content of\n    hydrogen in 1-2 m of the regolith. LEND collimated sensors CSETN1-4 and\n    SHEN detect epithermal neutrons and high energy neutrons with high\n    angular resolution to test water ice deposits on the lunar surface.\n \n    LEND measurements include:\n \n    a. Measurement of thermal neutrons with flux variation greater than 1%\n       and altitude-dependent spatial resolution about 50km.\n    b. Measurement of epithermal neutrons greater than 0.4 electron Volts\n       (eV) with flux variation about 2% (pole) and 10% (equator).\n    c. Measurement of high-energy neutrons 0.3 - 15.0 Mega-electron Volts\n       (MeV) with flux variations 4% (pole) and 10% (equator).\n \n    LEND operates autonomously, collecting data throughout the lunar orbit.\n    LEND generates approximately 0.26 Gbits of measurement data per day. In\n    order to perform early calibration measurements, LEND became active\n    shortly after the first mid course correction (MCC) burn. Operationally,\n    LEND is simple and has only three instrument modes: MEASUREMENTS,\n    STAND-BY, and OFF. While in MEASUREMENTS mode, instrument electronics\n    and detector high voltage are both 'on' and the instrument generates\n    measurement and housekeeping data. In STAND-BY mode, instrument\n    electronics are 'on', detector high voltage is 'off', and only\n    housekeeping data are generated. While in OFF mode, the instrument is\n    'off', the instrument external heater is 'on', and only external\n    temperature data are generated.\n \n    5. Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA): David Smith leads the LOLA\n    measurement investigation from GSFC. LOLA uses a 1064 nanometer (nm)\n    laser that expands to provide a five spot pattern on the Moon's\n    surface. A telescope receives the reflected light where the Electronics\n    processes the return.\n \n    The primary LOLA objectives are:\n \n    a. Produce a high-resolution global topographic model and global geodetic\n       framework that enables precise targeting, safe landing, and safe\n       mobility on the Moon's surface. LOLA determines the topography of the\n       Moon to geodetic quality from global to landing-site relevant scales.\n    b. Characterize the polar illumination environment at relevant temporal\n       scales, and image permanently shadowed regions of the Moon on landform\n       scales to identify possible locations of surface ice crystals in\n       shadowed polar craters.\n    c. Identify the locations of appreciable surface water ice in the\n       permanently shadowed regions of the Moon's polar cold traps.\n    d. Assess meter and smaller-scale features to facilitate safety analysis\n       of potential future lunar landing sites.\n \n    LOLA has two secondary objectives:\n \n    a. Establish a global geodetic reference system for the Moon.\n    b. Improve the model of the lunar gravity field to facilitate precision\n       navigation and landing.\n \n    LOLA has the following capabilities. It measures the distance between\n    the spacecraft and the surface which, along with the spacecraft\n    position, will allow precise measurements of the lunar shape. The\n    instrument lays down a laser spot pattern that provides altimetry\n    measurements along- and across-track to enable the surface slope to be\n    derived for safe landing. It measures the distribution of elevation\n    within the laser footprint for estimation of surface roughness (rock\n    size). LOLA also identifies regions of enhanced surface reflectance that\n    might indicate the presence of water ice on the surface.\n \n    LOLA achieves its measurement objectives as follows:\n \n    a. LOLA provides 5 profiles in a 70-meter swath.\n    b. The instrument provides full spatial sampling after one year:\n       i. ~ 1.2 km average spacing at equator\n       ii. ~ 25 m average spacing above 86 degrees north and south\n    c. The LOLA ground software performs cross-over analysis of LOLA data-\n       topography, slopes, and roughness are the same on both tracks.\n    d. LOLA data provide precision information about the orbiter's location-\n       S-band tracking data are augmented by Earth-based laser ranges.\n    e. LOLA data improve the lunar gravity field model via cross-over\n       analysis.\n \n    LOLA Mapping Data Products include the following:\n \n    a. Topography with average horizontal resolutions (after one year) of\n       1.2 km at equator and of 25 m at latitudes greater than 86 degrees,\n       with accuracies of +/-50 m in horizontal and less than 1 m in\n       vertical.\n    b.

Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC): Mark Robinson leads LROC\n    measurement investigation from Arizona State University (ASU). LROC\n    consists of two narrow angle cameras (NAC), a wide-angle camera (WAC),\n    and a Sequence and Compression System (SCS).\n \n    LROC measurement objectives include:\n \n    a. Landing site identification and certification, with unambiguous\n       identification of meter-scale hazards.\n    b. Unambiguous mapping of permanent shadows and sunlit regions.\n    c.

Miniature-Radio Frequency (Mini-RF): Ben Bussey of the Johns Hopkins\n    University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) leads the Mini-RF\n    measurement investigation. JHU/APL is responsible for instrument\n    operations. Mini-RF is a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) that consists of\n    a fixed planar antenna mounted on an external spacecraft surface, and a\n    cable harness between the electronics and the antenna. It operated on a\n    non-interference basis during the nominal mission. After Mini-RF ceased\n    acquiring monostatic radar data in December 2010, it began acquiring\n    bistatic radar measurements in 2011.\n \n    Mini-RF measurements include:\n \n    a. Imaging from 50km altitude surface areas that have been imaged by\n       Forerunner with the same dual polarization, resolution, and S-band\n       frequency as was used by Forerunner. The Forerunner instrument is\n       on the ISRO Chandrayaan-1 mission to the Moon.\n    b. Imaging polar areas with both S- and X-band, and at both baseline and\n       zoom resolutions\n    c. Acquiring data in a continuous transmit mode that is applicable for\n       topography generation using post processing techniques\n    d. Conducting a set of experiments to test the usability of Mini-RF\n       hardware as a communications asset.\n    e. Acquiring bistatic radar measurements from a high-power signal\n       transmitted from the Arecibo Observatory Planetary Radar and reflected\n       off the lunar surface.\n \n    Mini-RF Conops has six primary components:\n \n    a. The communications experiment consists of two 10-minute data takes,\n       approximately 24 hours apart, that occurred during the instrument\n       commissioning phase, before the nominal mission.\n    b. SAR Data Acquisition during nominal mission: Mini-RF acquired one\n       4-minute SAR data strip every month. Within this strip it is possible\n       to alternate between different SAR modes, e.g. S or X band, baseline\n       or zoom resolution. In addition, twice a year, Mini-RF acquired four\n       2-minute strips from four consecutive orbits.\n    c. Continuous Mode Data Acquisition during nominal mission:  Mini-RF\n       acquired one 4-minute SAR data strip every month. Additionally, twice\n       a year, Mini-RF acquired four 2-minute strips on four consecutive\n       orbits.\n    d. Mini-RF Exploration Utilization Plan (MEUP): additional polar campaign\n       data acquisitions were allowed during late nominal mission and early\n       science mission during periods where the Beta angle is greater than\n       60 degrees (to mitigate impact on spacecraft solar array).\n    e. During the science mission, a primary goal was to acquire significant\n        global-scale s-band zoom data.\n    f. Starting in 2011, Mini-RF was used to collect the first ever planetary\n       bistatic radar images at non Beta=0 angles, to determine if the Moon's\n       polar craters contain ice. These measurements can be used for studies\n       of the composition and structure of pyroclastic deposits, impact\n       ejecta and melts, and the lunar regolith.\n \n   8.  Radio Science (RS):  Gregory Neumann of the Goddard Space Flight Center\n   (GSFC) leads the Radio Science data collection effort.  Data and\n   Documentation are generated by the Universal Space Network, White Sands\n   Complex, Deep Space Network, the LRO Project, and the LOLA Science\n   Team. The Goddard Geophysical Astronomical Observatory provides satellite\n   laser ranging data and coordinates data from International Laser Ranging\n   Service partners in other countries.\n \n   Radio Science Data consist of primary and ancillary data; where the latter\n   are needed for the processing or interpretation of the former.  The\n   specific files that are being archived by the RS team are:\n \n   a. Tracking Data\n      The Station Raw Tracking Data support tracking of the orbiter and\n      generation of orbit and mission products.  Each ground station (WS1 and\n      the USN stations) creates data in a format identified as the Universal\n      Tracking Data Format (UTDF) as described in publication 453-HDBK-GN\n      (May 2007).\n   b. Weather Data\n      These ascii files are generated by various ground stations and record\n      information such as time, temperature, pressure, relative humidity and\n      wind speed.\n   c. Small Forces Files\n      These files include the updated parameters for thruster calibration\n      based on all information from past maneuvers.  An assessment is made of\n      the maneuver execution based on pre- and post-maneuver orbit solutions\n      and telemetry, which is then used to determine a thrust scale factor\n      for future maneuvers using the same thruster set.\n   d. Laser Ranging Data (normal point and full rate)\n      These data consist of one way range measurements via laser pulse\n      time-of-flight from Earth to LRO, using one of LOLA's laser detectors.\n      This is essential to meeting the spacecraft's precision orbit\n      determination requirement, but also has secondary scientific value.\n \n \n    Mission Phases\n    ==============\n \n    LAUNCH  2009-06-18  (2009-169)\n \n    The launch phase began with launch vehicle lift-off and lasted about 90\n    minutes until payload separation.

It lasted 2\n    years. During this phase, objectives that had not been determined were\n    to be realized, and impact planning and prediction would be performed.\n    The beginning of this phase marked the transition of LRO\n    programmatic control from the NASA Exploration Systems Mission\n    Directorate (ESMD) to the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD).\n \n    ------\n    EXTENDED SCIENCE MISSION  2012-09-15 to 2014-09-14 (2012-259 to 2014-257)\n \n    The extended science mission began at the completion of the two-year\n    Science mission (officially at 01:50 UTC on September 15, 2012). It lasted\n    2 years. During this phase, objectives included: understanding the\n    bombardment history of the Moon; interpreting lunar geologic processes;\n    mapping the global lunar regolith; identifying volatiles on the Moon;\n    and measuring the lunar atmosphere and radiation environment.\n \n    ------\n    SECOND EXTENDED SCIENCE MISSION  2014-09-15 to 2016-09-14 (2014-258 to\n    2016-259)\n \n    The second extended science mission (ESM2) began at the completion of\n    the two-year Extended Science Mission (ESM1).  The Second Extended\n    Science Mission began officially at 01:14:43 UTC on September 15, 2014.\n    It will last at least 2 years or until the orbiter impacts the lunar\n    surface.","image_url":"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/uploads/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/18/ee/18eebb49-b441-4552-b079-f577f7d816fa/lro.jpg__270x197_q85_crop_subject_location-910%2C511_subsampling-2.jpg","funding_level":"Flagship"},{"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:investigation:mission.lunar_crater_observation_and_sensing_satellite","display_name":"Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite","display_description":"LCROSS launched as a secondary payload with Lunar Reconnaissance\n    Orbiter (LRO) on June 18, 2009 5:32 Eastern Time.  After\n    trans-lunar injection, LRO separated and performed its mission.\n    The LCROSS Shepherding Spacecraft (SSC) remained attached to the\n    spent Atlas upper stage, called the Centaur.  Over 112 days, the\n    Shepherding Spacecraft adjusted the Centaur's course to bring it\n    to an impact within the Cabeus Crater near the South Pole of the\n    moon.\n \n    LCROSS used the Centaur as a 2300 kg kinetic impactor with more\n    than 200 times the energy of the Lunar Prospector (LP) impact to\n    excavate more than 250 metric tons of lunar regolith.  The\n    resulting ejecta cloud was observed from a number of\n    Lunar-orbital and Earth-based assets, and the LCROSS spacecraft.\n    After releasing the Centaur, the SSC flew toward the impact\n    plume, sending real-time data to characterize the morphology,\n    evolution and composition of the plume with a suite of cameras\n    and spectrometers.  The SSC then became a 700kg impactor itself,\n    providing a second opportunity to study the nature of the Lunar\n    Regolith.\n \n    Mission Phases\n    ==============\n \n    LCROSS and LRO launched on June 18, 2009 at 21:32 UTC aboard an\n    Atlas V launch vehicle in the 401 configuration (4-meter\n    fairing, no solid rocket boosters, single-engine Centaur).\n    After achieving low-Earth orbit, the Centaur performed a 23\n    minute coast, and then re-ignited to perform the trans-lunar\n    injection (TLI) burn for both LCROSS and LRO.\n \n    Three minutes after TLI, the Centaur separated from LRO and then\n    maneuvered to increase separation to avoid contaminating LRO.\n    To minimize the residual propellant species aboard the Centaur\n    at lunar impact (potential contaminants of water measurements),\n    the Centaur next performed a sequence of propellant depletion\n    maneuvers with both cryogenic and hydrazine-based reaction\n    control systems.  During these depetion maneuvers, the Centaur\n    powered the SSC up and pointed its solar array at the sun.\n    After the maneuvers were finished, the Centaur ceded attitude\n    control to the SSC and shut down.\n \n    ------\n    Transfer Phase [6/18/2009 - 6/23/2009]\n \n    The transfer phase covered the period from TLI to lunar\n    swingby.\n \n    This phase contained the QUICKLOOK and STARFIELD data collection\n    periods.  Both periods were used to confirm instrument function\n    and pointing prior to the lunar swingby.\n \n    ------\n    Lunar Swingby [6/23/2009]\n \n    The lunar swingby was a gravity assist maneuver that placed\n    LCROSS in a steeply-inclined, nearly circular orbit around Earth\n    at approximately lunar distance.  Called a Lunar Gravity Assist\n    Lunar Return Orbit (LGALRO), this trajectory returned LCROSS to\n    the moon again after three orbits.\n \n    Just after closest approach to the moon, the instruments were\n    pointed at the surface and turned on to gather calibration data.\n    The instruments were swept across the surface, pausing three\n    times at targets on the surface with distinctive spectral\n    characteristics.  Finally, the instruments were swept back and\n    forth across the limb.  This limb-crossing data was used to\n    confirm instrument pointing to within 0.1 degree.\n \n    ------\n    Cruise Phase\n \n    Cruise phase activities included trajectory correction\n    maneuvers and additional periods of payload data collection\n    observing the Earth and Moon.\n \n    Several 'Cold Side Bake' activities were also performed to\n    reduce ice in the Centaur insulation that remained since launch.\n    During these maneuvers, the SSC and Centaur were turned to place\n    cold side of the spacecraft, which was normally in darkness, in\n    sunlight.  Sublimating ice embedded in the insulation generated\n    enough thrust to be detectible in doppler measurements.  If left\n    in place, this ice could potentially have contaminated\n    observations of the Centaur's impact.\n \n    On the second half of the second Earth orbit, LCROSS experienced\n    a major propellant loss stemming from a short-lived Inertial\n    Reference Unit (IRU) glitch.  This was discovered immediately\n    before the third Cold Side Bake event.  With the mission in\n    jeopardy, LCROSS declared an emergency and transitioned to\n    maximum DSN coverage to enable full-time monitoring.  Over the\n    following two weeks, the flight team developed strategies to\n    prevent another glitch and to minimize propellant usage during\n    planned maneuvers.  With operational and software protections in\n    place, the LCROSS project returned to a nominal operational\n    posture on Day 78, albeit with a significantly smaller\n    propellant margin.\n \n    The deadline for final selection of the Centaur target crater\n    was 30 days prior to impact.  This late date allowed the Team to\n    use early data from LRO to improve the targeting decision.\n    During the final two weeks of cruise, the Science Team twice\n    refined the target location within the crater.\n \n    ------\n    Separation\n \n    Centaur separation was performed successfully 9 hours 40 minutes\n    prior to Centaur impact and, with the substantial change of mass\n    properties, was accompanied by a transition to a completely new\n    set of attitude control modes tuned for post-separation\n    conditions.  One minute following separation, the SSC flipped\n    180 degrees to point the payload at the receding Centaur.  These\n    observations are contained in the SEPARATION data collection\n    period.  Forty minutes after separation, the SSC performed the\n    Braking Burn, a delta-v maneuver used to produce a 600 km\n    separation between the Centaur and the SSC at the moment of\n    Centaur impact.\n \n    ------\n    Impact\n \n    Approximately one hour prior to centaur impact, the spacecraft\n    was turned to point the instruments at the predicted impact\n    location.  Fifty minutes of calibration data are contained in the\n    PREIMPACT data collection.  Five minutes of data are contained in\n    the IMPACT data collection, starting one minute prior to Centaur\n    impact.\n \n    The Centaur impacted the moon at 11:31:19.51 UTC on 10/9/2009 at\n    -84.68 deg latitude, -48.69 deg longitude, Mean Earth frame.\n \n    The SSC impacted the surface at 11:35:34 UTC.\n \n    Earth-based Observations\n    ========================\n \n    The LCROSS project provided funding for four investigators to record\n    Earth-based observations of the LCROSS impact using various observatory\n    facilities, and to archive their data in the PDS.

By very precisely measuring the distance of\n    one orbiter relative to the other, the orbital perturbations\n    caused by the Moon could be observed. Combining this with the\n    orbiter position as determined from Earth-based observations, the\n    mass distribution on the Moon could be determined.\n \n    The GRAIL spacecraft were launched side-by-side on a single Delta\n    II vehicle during a 26-day launch window that opened on September\n    8, 2011. The actual launch was two days later.  The mission\n    timeline was constructed to ensure continuity in operations by\n    avoiding lunar eclipses on December 10, 2011, and June 4, 2012,\n    when spacecraft power from the solar panels would be interrupted.\n    The Goldstone DSN complex acquired initial spacecraft signals and\n    confirmed solar array deployment.\n \n    The trans-lunar cruise phase consisted of a 3.5-month low-energy\n    transfer via the Sun-Earth Lagrange point 1 (EL1). Compared to a\n    direct trajectory, this low-energy transfer reduced spacecraft\n    fuel requirements (by approximately 130 m/s), allowed more time\n    for spacecraft check-out and out-gassing, and increased the number\n    of days available in the launch window each month.\n \n    Both spacecraft approached the Moon under the South Pole where they\n    each executed a 41-minute Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) maneuver to\n    put them into an elliptical orbit with a period of 11.5 hours. The\n    LOIs for the two spacecraft were separated by one day. Each LOI\n    was simultaneously visible from the Goldstone and Canberra DSN\n    complexes.\n \n    A series of four maneuvers were then performed to reduce the orbits\n    to nearly circular with a mean 55-km altitude and 113-minute\n    period. Further maneuvers positioned the spacecraft to the desired\n    initial separation distance, which then drifted between 65 km and\n    225 km.\n \n    The 90-day Science Phase was divided into three 27.3-day\n    nadir-pointed mapping cycles. Two daily 8-hour DSN tracking passes\n    acquired science and 'E/PO MoonKam' data.\n \n    Following the Extended Mission Phase (August 29 - December 12,\n    2012), there was a 6-day decommissioning period, after which the\n    spacecraft impacted the lunar surface.\n \n    For more information on the GRAIL mission, see [RONCOLI&FUJII2010].\n \n  Mission Phases\n  ==============\n    The GRAIL Mission was divided into eight phases: Launch, Cruise,\n    Orbit Insertion, Transition to Science, Science, Hiatus, Extended\n    Mission, and Decommissioning.\n \n    LAUNCH\n    ------\n    The Launch Phase extended from the start of the countdown to the\n    initial acquisition, by the DSN, of the orbiters in a safe and\n    stable configuration.\n \n    The twin orbiters were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force\n    Station, Florida, on a Delta II Heavy shortly after the opening of\n    the launch window in September 2011. There were at least 21 launch\n    opportunities within this 26-day window. The Goldstone DSN complex\n    acquired the initial signal, as well as confirmation of solar\n    array deployment.\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2011-09-10\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2011-09-10\n \n    CRUISE\n    ------\n    The Cruise Phase extended from after DSN initial acquisition of\n    the orbiters in a safe and stable configuration until the first\n    Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) maneuver.\n \n    The orbiters followed a low-energy trajectory to the Moon, which\n    took them near the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1 (EL1). The low-energy\n    trajectory minimized the velocity change (dV) required for\n    insertion into lunar orbit. During the 112-day cruise, several\n    maneuvers were executed on each orbiter to adjust the trajectory.\n    One maneuver placed the orbiter on the low-energy trajectory and\n    another separated the Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) maneuvers for\n    each orbiter by about a day. The remaining maneuvers were used to\n    fine tune the trajectory.\n \n    The low-energy transfer was chosen to reduce the spacecraft fuel\n    requirements (by ~130 m/s), to allow more time for spacecraft\n    check-out and out-gassing, and to increase the number of days\n    available in the launch window each month.\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2011-09-10\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2011-12-31\n \n    ORBIT INSERTION\n    ---------------\n    This phase included the propulsive maneuvers to insert the two\n    spacecraft into lunar orbit. The maneuvers were separated by about\n    25 hours, with the GRAIL-A maneuver occurring on December 31, 2011,\n    and the GRAIL-B maneuver occurring on January 1, 2012.\n \n    Both spacecraft approached the Moon under the South Pole where\n    they each executed a 41-minute Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI)\n    maneuver to put them into an elliptical orbit with a period of\n    about 11.5 hours. Each LOI was simultaneously visible from the\n    Goldstone and Canberra DSN complexes.\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2011-12-31\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2012-01-01\n \n    TRANSITION TO SCIENCE\n    ---------------------\n    Once in lunar orbit, and after checkout of the orbiter systems,\n    several maneuvers were performed on each orbiter to reduce the\n    orbit period and lower the altitude to the science orbit. These\n    maneuvers were grouped into two clusters, with each cluster\n    spanning about a week; clusters alternated between GRAIL-A and\n    GRAIL-B. Each maneuver cluster used the same maneuver design,\n    which reduced the workload on the operations teams. The orbit\n    period was reduced to 113 minutes.\n \n    A series of maneuvers was then performed to establish the proper\n    spacecraft formation at the start of the Science Phase. These\n    maneuvers positioned the spacecraft to the desired initial\n    separation distance, which would then drift between 65 km and 225\n    km.\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2012-01-01\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2012-03-01\n \n    SCIENCE\n    -------\n    The 90-day Science Phase was divided into three 27.3-day\n    nadir-pointed mapping cycles. Two daily 8-hour DSN tracking passes\n    acquired science and 'E/PO MoonKam' data.\n \n    The Science Phase of the mission was conducted from a\n    near-circular, near-polar orbit with a mean altitude of 55 km.\n    There were three different mapping cycles during the Science\n    Phase, each covering a sidereal month (27.32 days). The first\n    mapping cycle started while the science orbit had low periapsis\n    altitudes with an orbiter separation distance of approximately 85\n    kilometers. Over the course of the first mapping cycle, and into\n    the second mapping cycle, the periapsis altitudes of the science\n    orbit increased, and the mean separation distance slowly drifted\n    to 225 kilometers. A small Orbit Trim Maneuver (OTM) was performed\n    during the second mapping cycle to decrease the separation drift\n    rate. Following this OTM to the end of the third mapping cycle,\n    the periapsis altitudes decreased, and the mean separation between\n    the orbiters slowly drifted from 225 km back to 65 km.\n \n    During the Science Phase, data were stored onboard and downlinked\n    as bandwidth became available. Each orbiter received an average of\n    twelve hours of tracking coverage per day.\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2012-03-01\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2012-05-29\n \n    HIATUS\n    ------\n    In the Hiatus Phase the beta-angle, which determines the amount of\n    sunlight on the solar panels and controls the amount of energy\n    available to the spacecraft, dropped below its threshold.  Science\n    operations were suspended and the two spacecraft executed a series\n    of maneuvers to re-position themselves for beta-angles above the\n    threshold prior to the start of the Extended Mission.\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2012-05-29\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2012-08-29\n \n    EXTENDED MISSION\n    ----------------\n    GRAIL proposed (and NASA approved) an Extended Mission, since\n    there was sufficient fuel in the two spacecraft to acquire\n    additional science data.  The mean spacecraft altitude was\n    lowered by about a factor of 2 to increase the sensitivity of the\n    gravity measurements, and GRAIL defined a new set of science\n    objectives.  As in the Science Phase, the spacecraft separation\n    distance was variable.  DSN coverage was comparable.\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2012-08-29\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2012-12-12\n \n    DECOMMISSIONING\n    ---------------\n    Science data were collected during the Decommissioning Phase as in\n    the Extended Mission phase. After final calibrations, the\n    Decommissioning Phase ended with impact of the spacecraft on the\n    lunar surface.\n \n      Mission Phase Start Time : 2012-12-12\n      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2012-12-18","funding_level":"Flagship","image_url":"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZzEx7_MW2g4/TmvZA-oWnbI/AAAAAAAACHA/Lg3-95-pZ4c/s1600/GRAIL-logo.JPG"},{"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:investigation:mission.dawn_mission_to_vesta_and_ceres","display_name":"Dawn","display_description":"The Dawn mission launched in Sept. 2007 to rendezvous and orbit the asteroids 4 Vesta and 1 Ceres.

To do so it had to be stowed with its booms retracted, and with its antenna dish facing forward (i.e. upward on the launch pad).\n\nThe spacecraft comprises several distinct subsystems: a general structure, an attitude control and propulsion system, a communications system, thermal control system, electrical power system, navigation system, and, most important to the scientific mission, a payload of 11 onboard instruments.\n\nTo communicate over long distances the spacecraft's dish-shaped antenna has to be pointed toward Earth. A simple and inexpensive way to do this is to spin stabilize the spacecraft and keep the spin axis pointed to Earth. So the spacecraft is stabilized by rotation.\n\n\nGeneral Structure \n----------------- \n\nEach spacecraft is 2.9-meters long from its cone-shaped, medium-gain antenna to the adapter ring which fastened the spacecraft to stage three of the launch vehicle.\n\nSpacecraft structure centers around a 36-cm deep, flat, equipment compartment, the top and bottom of which are regular hexagons. Its sides are each 71-cm long. One joins to a smaller 'squashed' hexagonal compartment that carries most of the scientific experiments.\n\nThe 2.74-meter diameter, 46-cm deep, parabolic, dish-shaped, high-gain antenna of aluminum honeycomb sandwich material is attached to the front of the equipment compartment. Its feed is topped with a medium-gain antenna on three struts which project about 1.2 meters forward. A low-gain, omni antenna extends about 0.76 meters behind the equipment compartment, mounted below the high-gain dish.\n\nTwo three-rod trusses, 120 degrees apart, project from two sides of the equipment compartment. At their ends, nuclear electric power generators are held about 3 meters from the center of the spacecraft. A third boom, 120 degrees from the other two, projects from the experiment compartment and positions a magnetometer sensor about 6.6 meters from the center of the spacecraft. All three booms are extended after launch.\n\n\nAttitude Control and Propulsion\n------------------------------- \n\nThe spacecraft possesses a star sensor to provide a reference on the bright southern star Canopus, and two sun sensors to provide a reference to the Sun. Attitude position is calculated from the reference direction to the Earth and the Sun, with the known direction to Canopus provided as backup. Pioneer 11 's star sensor gain and threshold settings were modified to improve performance based on experience with this sensor on Pioneer 10.\n\nThree pairs of rocket thrusters located near the rim of the antenna dish are used to direct the spin axis of the spacecraft, to keep it spinning at the desired rate of 4.8 revolutions per minute, and to change the spacecraft's velocity. The system's six thruster nozzles can be fired steadily or pulsed by command.\n\nEach thruster develops its propulsive jet force from the decomposition of liquid hydrazine by a catalyst in a small rocket thrust chamber attached to the nozzle of the thrusters.\n\nAttitude and velocity changes are made by two thruster pairs mounted on opposite sides of the antenna dish rim. One thruster of each pair points forward, the other, aft. To change attitude, the spacecraft spin axis is rotated in the desired direction by firing two thrusters, one on each side of the antenna dish. One thruster is fired forward, one aft, in brief thrust pulses at a precise position in the circle of spacecraft rotation. Each thrust pulse, timed to the spacecraft's rotation, moves (precesses) the spin axis a few tenths of a degree, until the desired attitude is reached.\n\nTo change velocity, the spin axis is precessed until it points in the desired direction, then two thruster nozzles, one on each side of the antenna dish, are fired continuously, both in the same direction, i.e., forward or aft to increase or decrease the flight path velocity.\n\nTo adjust spin rate, two more pairs of thrusters, also set along the rim of the antenna dish, are used. These thrusters are aligned tangentially to the antenna rim, one pointing against the direction of spin and the other with it. Thus to reduce spin rate, two thrusters fire against spin direction.\n\n\nCommunications\n-------------- \n\nThe spacecraft carries two identical receivers. The omni and medium-gain antennas operate together and as such are connected to one receiver while the high-gain is connected to the other, though the receivers do not operate together. The receivers can be interchanged by command, or, should there be a period of inactivity, automatically. Thus, should a receiver fail during the mission, the other can automatically take over.\n\nTwo radio transmitters, coupled to two traveling-wave-tube power amplifiers, each produce 8 watts of power in S-band.\n\nThe communication frequency uplink from Earth to the spacecraft is at 2110 MHz, the downlink to Earth at 2292 MHz. The turnaround ratio, downlink to uplink, is precisely controlled to be compatible with the Deep Space Network.\n\nThe spacecraft data system turns science and engineering information into a specially coded stream of data bits for radio transmission to Earth. A convolutional encoder rearranges the data in a form that allows detection and correction of most errors by a ground computer at the receiving site of the Deep Space Network. There are 11 data formats divided into science and engineering data groups. Some science formats are optimized for interplanetary data, others for the Jovian encounter. Engineering data formats specialize in data handling, electrical, communications, orientation, and propulsion data. All formats are selected by ground command.\n\n\nThermal Control\n--------------- \n\nTemperature on the spacecraft is controlled at between -23 and 38 degrees C inside the scientific instrument compartment, and at various other levels elsewhere for satisfactory operation of the onboard equipment.\n\nThe temperature control system coped with gradually decreasing heating as the spacecraft moved away from the Sun, and with two frigid periods - one when Pioneer 10 passed through Earth's shadow at launch; the other at the time of passage through Jupiter's shadow during flyby. The system also controlled the effects of heat from the third-stage engine, atmosphere friction, spacecraft nuclear electric power generators, and other equipment.\n\nThe equipment compartments are insulated by multi-layered blankets of aluminized plastic. Temperature-responsive louvers at the bottom of the equipment compartment, opened by bi-metallic springs, allow controlled escape of excess heat. Other equipment has individual thermal insulation and is warmed by electric heaters and 12 one-watt radioisotope heaters, fueled with plutonium-238.\n\n\nElectrical Power \n---------------- \n\nNuclear-fueled electric power for Pioneer Jupiter comes from the four SNAP-19 type Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs), developed by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), similar to those used to power the Nimbus-3 meteorological satellite. These units turn heat from plutonium-238 into electricity.\n\nThe RTGs are on the opposite side of the spacecraft from the scientific instrument compartment to reduce the effects of their neutron radiation on the instruments. Mounted two each on the end of each boom, these four RTGs developed about 155 watts of electrical power at launch, which decayed to approximately 140 watts by the time the spacecraft reached Jupiter. One hundred watts output is expected five years after launch. The depletion of power is not from the nuclear source itself but from deterioration of the junctions of the thermocouples which convert heat into electricity. The RTGs supply adequate power for the mission since the spacecraft needs only 100 watts to operate all systems, of which 26 watts are for the science instruments. Excess power from the RTGs over that needed by the spacecraft is radiated to space thermally through a shunt radiator, or charges a battery which automatically supplies additional power needed for short periods when the spacecraft demands more power than the output of the RTGs.\n\n\nNavigation\n---------- \n\nThe axis of the high-gain antenna dish is slightly offset from, but parallel to, the spin axis of the spacecraft within close tolerances throughout the mission. Except during initial stages of the flight near Earth and for periods when alignment must be changed to suit course correction, the spin axis of the spacecraft is always pointed toward Earth within a tolerance of one degree to provide best communication.\n\nAnalysts use the shift in frequency of the Pioneer radio signal and angle tracking by the antennas of the Deep Space Net to calculate the speed, distance, and direction of the spacecraft from Earth. Motion of the spacecraft away from Earth causes the frequency of the spacecraft's radio signals to drop and their wavelength to increase. Known as a Doppler shift, this effect allows the speed of the spacecraft to be calculated from measurement of the frequency change in the signal received at Earth.\n\nThe radio beam is offset one degree from the spin axis. As a result, when the spin axis is not directed exactly towards Earth, uplink signals received at the spacecraft from Earth vary in intensity synchronously with rotation of the spacecraft. A system on the spacecraft, known as Conical Scan (CONSCAN), was originally intended to be automatically used to change the spacecraft's attitude in a direction to reduce these variations in signal strength, thereby returning the spin axis to the precise Earth point to within the threshold of 0.3 degrees. However, flight operations personnel developed and used a direct command technique that results in conserving the spacecraft's gas supply.\n\n\nScientific Payload \n\n------------------ \n\nInvestigation of interplanetary space on the way to and beyond Jupiter aimed to resolve a number of unknowns about the magnetic field in interplanetary space; cosmic rays, fast moving parts of atoms from both the Sun and the Galaxy; the solar wind, a flow of charged particles from the Sun, and its relationships with the interplanetary magnetic field and cosmic rays; and interplanetary dust concentrations, if any, in the asteroid belt.\n\n[INSTRUMENT_HOST_DESC was adapted from FIMMELETAL pp. 39-45.]","image_url":"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/system/content_pages/main_images/1362_Pioneer11_1600.jpg","tools":[]},{"tags":["Flyby"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.vg1","display_name":"Voyager 1","display_description":"Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    For most Voyager experiments, data were collected by\n    instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed\n    via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space\n    Network (DSN) on Earth.  Radio Science experiments (such as\n    radio occultations) required that DSN hardware also participate\n    in data acquisition.  The following sections provide an\n    overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground\n    system as both supported Voyager science activities.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n  =====================================\n    The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft were identical and were\n    built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  With a mass of\n    815 kilograms, each carried its own power, propulsion, and\n    communications systems and its own science instruments.\n    Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope\n    Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.\n    The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),\n    Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem\n    (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyros\n    provided physical propulsion and attitude control.\n    Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried\n    out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band\n    frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.\n    A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits\n    when no Earth station was available for real-time data\n    transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of\n    several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation\n    for days or weeks at a time.  More information on the\n    spacecraft can be found in [MORRISON1982], [KOHLHASE1989], and\n    [JPLPD618-128].\n \n    The spacecraft itself was built around its 'bus' -- a decagonal\n    prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm\n    deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a\n    'bay' containing engineering systems or science instrument\n    electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio\n    transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the\n    end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through\n    10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending\n    away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan\n    platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer\n    boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.\n \n \n    Spacecraft Coordinate System\n    ----------------------------\n      The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the\n      spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft\n      coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight\n      defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was\n      also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180\n      degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting\n      the scan platform, extended in the general direction of\n      positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle\n      90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180\n      degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  A boom supporting the RTGs\n      was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.\n      The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate\n      system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed\n      through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction\n      which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.\n      The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle\n      305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).\n \n \n    Telecommunications Subsystem\n    ----------------------------\n      The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,\n      pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic\n      reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted\n      simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and\n      X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna\n      beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.\n      The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure\n      of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the\n      hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.\n \n      The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a\n      redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed\n      functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by\n      swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit\n      science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and\n      115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band\n      link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions\n      sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per\n      second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by\n      the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the\n      Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).\n \n      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink\n      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from\n      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could\n      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the\n      received signal drifted.\n \n \n    Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem\n    -------------------------------------------\n      The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)\n      provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft\n      could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude\n      control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial\n      reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan\n      platform, upon which the four 'remote sensing' instruments\n      were mounted.\n \n      Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory\n      corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to\n      several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with\n      tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less\n      than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less\n      than 0.05 degrees per hour.\n \n      Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a\n      sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright\n      star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,\n      after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When\n      the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount\n      from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters\n      which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The\n      Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium\n      sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and\n      its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star\n      Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,\n      an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of\n      +/-0.05 degrees.\n \n      Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers\n      were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of\n      the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the\n      instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --\n      elevation and azimuth (see below).\n \n \n    Propulsion Subsystem\n    --------------------\n      The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of\n      16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to\n      control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two\n      thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to\n      perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two\n      oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative\n      roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw\n      turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform\n      negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform\n      positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to\n      perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was\n      connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.\n \n \n    Power Subsystem\n    ---------------\n      Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope\n      Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the\n      negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted\n      7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG\n      electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because\n      of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and\n      degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The\n      difference between available electrical power and the power\n      required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the\n      'power margin.' Voyager Project guidelines required a power\n      margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical\n      transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was\n      dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.\n \n \n    Data Storage Subsystem\n    ----------------------\n      The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when\n      real-time communications with Earth were either not possible\n      or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;\n      rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6\n      kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per\n      second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12\n      images or equivalent.\n \n \n    Computer Command Subsystem\n    --------------------------\n      The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two\n      identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and\n      associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central\n      controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager\n      mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used\n      non-redundantly to increase the command and processing\n      capability of the spacecraft.\n \n \n    Flight Data Subsystem\n    ---------------------\n      The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two\n      reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding\n      hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and\n      engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.\n      Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from\n      the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-\n      Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.\n      Data compression was also performed within the FDS.\n \n \n    Science Boom\n    ------------\n      The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma\n      detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged\n      particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the\n      science boom.\n \n \n    Scan Platform\n    -------------\n      Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red\n      Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)\n      were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by\n      motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan\n      platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset\n      (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;\n      the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation\n      (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform\n      azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero\n      azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators\n      were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of\n      each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error\n      of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma\n      per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and\n      Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL has shown larger\n      errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.\n      High rate slews were at 1 deg/sec, medium rate slews were at\n      0.33 deg/sec, and low rate slews were at 0.08 deg/sec.\n \n \n    Magnetometer Boom\n    -----------------\n      Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long\n      boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after\n      Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of\n      the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the\n      end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base\n      of the boom.\n \n \n    Science Sensors\n    ---------------\n      Each Voyager spacecraft carried instrumentation to support\n      eleven science investigations.  Target body (or remote\n      sensing) instruments included:\n \n      (1) Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)\n      (2) Photopolarimeter Subsystem (PPS)\n      (3) Infrared Radiometer Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS)\n      (4) Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)\n \n      Fields, waves, and particles (or in situ) sensors included:\n \n      (1) Plasma Subsystem (PLS)\n      (2) Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP)\n      (3) Cosmic-Ray Subsystem (CRS)\n      (4) Magnetic Fields (MAG)\n      (5) Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS)\n      (6) Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA)\n \n      The Radio Science (RSS) investigation was carried out using\n      the on-board and ground elements of the Telecommunications\n      Subsystem (TCS).  More information on instrumentation for\n      each of the science investigations can be found elsewhere.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    Voyager Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation\n    with elements on both the spacecraft and at ground stations of\n    the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this was shared\n    equipment, used for routine telecommunications as well as for\n    Radio Science.\n \n    The DSN is a telecommunications facility managed by the Jet\n    Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology\n    for NASA.  The primary function of the DSN is to provide\n    two-way communications between the Earth and spacecraft\n    exploring the solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN\n    is equipped with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers\n    and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n    During the Voyager era the DSN consisted of three complexes\n    situated at approximately equally spaced longitudinal intervals\n    around the globe at Goldstone (near Barstow, California),\n    Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra,\n    Australia).  Two of the complexes are located in the northern\n    hemisphere while the third is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n    The network comprised several subnets, each of which included\n    one antenna at each complex.  The subnets were defined\n    according to the properties of their respective antennas.  Over\n    the course of the Voyager Mission, those antennas were expanded\n    and improved.  Nominal dimensions at the end (and beginning) of\n    the Voyager Mission were: 70-m diameter (initially 64-m),\n    standard 34-m diameter (initially 26-m), and high-efficiency\n    34-m diameter (did not exist at beginning of Voyager).\n \n    Additional ground equipment was provided by the Commonwealth\n    Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in\n    Australia, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science\n    (ISAS) in Japan, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory\n    (NRAO) in the United States.  For the Voyager 2 encounters with\n    Uranus and Neptune, the CSIRO 64-m diameter radio astronomy\n    antenna near Parkes (Australia) was included in the receiving\n    system for both telemetry and Radio Science.  For the Voyager 2\n    encounter with Neptune, the ISAS 64-m diameter antenna near\n    Usuda (Japan) was added for Radio Science and the NRAO Very\n    Large Array (VLA) near Socorro (New Mexico) was added for\n    telemetry.  The VLA consisted of 27 25-m antennas.  Parkes,\n    Usuda, and the VLA were integrated with the permanent stations\n    at Goldstone, Robledo, and Tidbinbilla by DSN personnel.\n \n \n  Acronyms and Abbreviations\n  ==========================\n    AACS       Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem\n    CCS        Computer Command Subsystem\n    CDU        Command Detector Unit\n    CRS        Cosmic Ray (investigation) Subsystem\n    CSIRO      Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research\n               Organization\n    DSN        Deep Space Network\n    DTR        Digital Tape Recorder\n    FDS        Flight Data Subsystem\n    HGA        High-Gain Antenna\n    IRIS       Infra-Red Interferometric Spectrometer\n    ISAS       Institute for Space and Astronautical Science\n    ISS        Imaging Science Subsystem\n    JPL        Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n    kbps       kilobits per second\n    LECP       Low-Energy Charged Particle (investigation subsystem)\n    LGA        Low-Gain Antenna\n    MAG        Magnetometer (subsystem)\n    NAIF       Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility\n    NASA       National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n    NRAO       National Radio Astronomy Observatory\n    PLS        Plasma (science investigation) Subsystem\n    PPS        PhotoPolarimeter Subsystem\n    PRA        Planetary Radio Astronomy (investigation subsystem)\n    PWS        Plasma Wave (investigation) Subsystem\n    RSS        Radio Science Subsystem\n    RTG        Radioisotopic Thermoelectric Generator\n    TCS        TeleCommunications Subsystem\n    UVS        Ultra-Violet Spectrometer\n    VLA        Very Large Array","image_url":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/voyager/20170731/PIA21839-16.jpg","tools":[3]},{"tags":["Flyby"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.vg2","display_name":"Voyager 2","display_description":"Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    For most Voyager experiments, data were collected by\n    instruments on the spacecraft.

Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by\n      the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the\n      Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).\n \n      Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink\n      signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from\n      relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could\n      result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the\n      received signal drifted.  Unfortunately, a series of failures\n      in the Voyager 2 receivers left that transponder unable to\n      track the uplink signal.  Beginning in April 1978, Doppler\n      shifts were predicted and the uplink carrier was tuned so\n      that Voyager 2 would see what appeared to be a signal at\n      constant frequency (to an accuracy of 100 Hz).\n \n \n    Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem\n    -------------------------------------------\n      The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)\n      provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft\n      could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude\n      control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial\n      reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan\n      platform, upon which the four 'remote sensing' instruments\n      were mounted.\n \n      Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory\n      corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to\n      several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with\n      tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less\n      than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less\n      than 0.05 degrees per hour.\n \n      Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a\n      sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright\n      star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,\n      after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When\n      the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount\n      from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters\n      which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The\n      Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium\n      sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and\n      its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star\n      Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,\n      an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of\n      +/-0.05 degrees.\n \n      Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers\n      were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of\n      the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the\n      instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --\n      elevation and azimuth (see below).\n \n \n    Propulsion Subsystem\n    --------------------\n      The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of\n      16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to\n      control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two\n      thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to\n      perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two\n      oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative\n      roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw\n      turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform\n      negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform\n      positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to\n      perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was\n      connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.\n \n \n    Power Subsystem\n    ---------------\n      Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope\n      Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the\n      negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted\n      7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG\n      electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because\n      of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and\n      degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The\n      difference between available electrical power and the power\n      required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the\n      'power margin.' Voyager Project guidelines required a power\n      margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical\n      transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was\n      dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.\n \n \n    Data Storage Subsystem\n    ----------------------\n      The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when\n      real-time communications with Earth were either not possible\n      or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;\n      rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6\n      kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per\n      second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12\n      images or equivalent.\n \n \n    Computer Command Subsystem\n    --------------------------\n      The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two\n      identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and\n      associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central\n      controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager\n      mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used\n      non-redundantly to increase the command and processing\n      capability of the spacecraft.\n \n \n    Flight Data Subsystem\n    ---------------------\n      The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two\n      reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding\n      hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and\n      engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.\n      Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from\n      the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-\n      Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.\n      Data compression was also performed within the FDS.\n \n \n    Science Boom\n    ------------\n      The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma\n      detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged\n      particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the\n      science boom.\n \n \n    Scan Platform\n    -------------\n      Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red\n      Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)\n      were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by\n      motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan\n      platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset\n      (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;\n      the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation\n      (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform\n      azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero\n      azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators\n      were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of\n      each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error\n      of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma\n      per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and\n      Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL has shown larger\n      errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.\n      High rate slews of 1 deg/sec were discontinued after the\n      azimuth drive mechanism on Voyager 2 temporarily froze a\n      short time after Saturn closest approach.  The medium slew\n      rate was 0.33 deg/sec, and the low slew rate was 0.08\n      deg/sec.\n \n \n    Magnetometer Boom\n    -----------------\n      Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long\n      boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after\n      Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of\n      the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the\n      end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base\n      of the boom.\n \n \n    Science Sensors\n    ---------------\n      Each Voyager spacecraft carried instrumentation to support\n      eleven science investigations.  Target body (or remote\n      sensing) instruments included:\n \n      (1) Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)\n      (2) Photopolarimeter Subsystem (PPS)\n      (3) Infrared Radiometer Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS)\n      (4) Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)\n \n      Fields, waves, and particles (or in situ) sensors included:\n \n      (1) Plasma Subsystem (PLS)\n      (2) Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP)\n      (3) Cosmic-Ray Subsystem (CRS)\n      (4) Magnetic Fields (MAG)\n      (5) Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS)\n      (6) Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA)\n \n      The Radio Science (RSS) investigation was carried out using\n      the on-board and ground elements of the Telecommunications\n      Subsystem (TCS).  More information on instrumentation for\n      each of the science investigations can be found elsewhere.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    Voyager Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation\n    with elements on both the spacecraft and at ground stations of\n    the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this was shared\n    equipment, used for routine telecommunications as well as for\n    Radio Science.\n \n    The DSN is a telecommunications facility managed by the Jet\n    Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology\n    for NASA.  The primary function of the DSN is to provide\n    two-way communications between the Earth and spacecraft\n    exploring the solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN\n    is equipped with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers\n    and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n    During the Voyager era the DSN consisted of three complexes\n    situated at approximately equally spaced longitudinal intervals\n    around the globe at Goldstone (near Barstow, California),\n    Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra,\n    Australia).  Two of the complexes are located in the northern\n    hemisphere while the third is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n    The network comprised several subnets, each of which included\n    one antenna at each complex.  The subnets were defined\n    according to the properties of their respective antennas.  Over\n    the course of the Voyager Mission, those antennas were expanded\n    and improved.  Nominal dimensions at the end (and beginning) of\n    the Voyager Mission were: 70-m diameter (initially 64-m),\n    standard 34-m diameter (initially 26-m), and high-efficiency\n    34-m diameter (did not exist at beginning of Voyager).\n \n    Additional ground equipment was provided by the Commonwealth\n    Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in\n    Australia, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science\n    (ISAS) in Japan, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory\n    (NRAO) in the United States.  For the Voyager 2 encounters with\n    Uranus and Neptune, the CSIRO 64-m diameter radio astronomy\n    antenna near Parkes (Australia) was included in the receiving\n    system for both telemetry and Radio Science.  For the Voyager 2\n    encounter with Neptune, the ISAS 64-m diameter antenna near\n    Usuda (Japan) was added for Radio Science and the NRAO Very\n    Large Array (VLA) near Socorro (New Mexico) was added for\n    telemetry.  The VLA consisted of 27 25-m antennas.  Parkes,\n    Usuda, and the VLA were integrated with the permanent stations\n    at Goldstone, Robledo, and Tidbinbilla by DSN personnel.\n \n \n  Acronyms and Abbreviations\n  ==========================\n    AACS       Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem\n    CCS        Computer Command Subsystem\n    CDU        Command Detector Unit\n    CRS        Cosmic Ray (investigation) Subsystem\n    CSIRO      Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research\n               Organization\n    DSN        Deep Space Network\n    DTR        Digital Tape Recorder\n    FDS        Flight Data Subsystem\n    HGA        High-Gain Antenna\n    IRIS       Infra-Red Interferometric Spectrometer\n    ISAS       Institute for Space and Astronautical Science\n    ISS        Imaging Science Subsystem\n    JPL        Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n    kbps       kilobits per second\n    LECP       Low-Energy Charged Particle (investigation subsystem)\n    LGA        Low-Gain Antenna\n    MAG        Magnetometer (subsystem)\n    NAIF       Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility\n    NASA       National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n    NRAO       National Radio Astronomy Observatory\n    PLS        Plasma (science investigation) Subsystem\n    PPS        PhotoPolarimeter Subsystem\n    PRA        Planetary Radio Astronomy (investigation subsystem)\n    PWS        Plasma Wave (investigation) Subsystem\n    RSS        Radio Science Subsystem\n    RTG        Radioisotopic Thermoelectric Generator\n    TCS        TeleCommunications Subsystem\n    UVS        Ultra-Violet Spectrometer\n    VLA        Very Large Array","image_url":"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/system/content_pages/main_images/1074_vgr2.jpg","tools":[3]},{"tags":["Orbiter"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.co","display_name":"Cassini Orbiter","display_description":"The Cassini Orbiter's mission consists of delivering a probe, called Huygens, to Titan, and then remaining in orbit around Saturn for detailed studies of the planet and its rings and satellites.","image_url":"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_feature/public/cassini_black.png","html1":"<p><b>More Info: </b><a href=\"https://atmos.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/Cassini/Cassini.html\">Cassini Mission Details </a> at PDS Atmospheres node<br/></p>","tools":[5,2,3]},{"tags":["Atmospheric Probe"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.hp","display_name":"Huygens Probe","display_description":"Huygens is an ESA atmospheric probe designed to make in situ observations of the Saturnian satellite Titan for the Cassini mission.","image_url":"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/internal_resources/1434"},{"tags":["Lander"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.phx","display_name":"Phoenix","display_description":"Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    For most Phoenix Mars Scout Lander experiments, data was collected by\n    instruments on the  spacecraft. Those data were then relayed directly\n    to stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN)  on Earth or\n    indirectly using the Mars orbiters Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) or 2001\n    Mars Odyssey  (ODY). The following sections provide an overview first\n    of the Phoenix spacecraft, then of the DSN  ground system, and finally\n    of the 2001 Mars Odyssey, as each supported Phoenix science\n    activities.\n \n  Instrument Host Description\n  ===========================\n \n    The Mars Phoenix Lander was build for the canceled Mars 2000 Lander\n    Mission. The spacecraft  was refurbished and held as the instrument\n    host for the Phoenix mission [SMITHETAL2008]. Phoenix  was the first\n    of the Scout class mission and consisted of a single lander with\n    associated  instrumentation. The Lander was about 18 feet (5.5 meters)\n    long with the solar panels deployed, and  the science deck by itself\n    was about 5 feet (1.5 meters) in diameter. From the ground to the top\n    of the  MET mast, the Lander measured about 7 feet (2.2 meters) tall.\n    The Lander weighed 350 kg, or 770 lbs.  It was launched on August 4,\n    2007, on a Delta II 7925 launch vehicle, and was operational until\n    November 2, 2008, performing on the Martian surface for 152 sols.\n \n    Power was generated during the cruise stage by two gallium arsenide\n    solar panels (total area  3.1 m2, or 33 ft2) mounted to the cruise\n    stage. After touchdown, Phoenix relied on two octagonal  gallium\n    arsenide solar panel wings extending from the Lander base to charge\n    its battery for operations.  Input from the solar panels was\n    sufficient to power daytime operations, but nighttime operations\n    required additional power from the Lander heater system.\n \n    Phoenix communicated directly with Earth using the X-band portion of\n    the radio spectrum (8  to 12 gigahertz) throughout the launch and\n    cruise stages. Continuous and instantaneous  communication with the\n    spacecraft was maintained throughout the launch phase, switching to\n    communication every three days in the cruise phase.  All X-band\n    capability was lost once the cruise  stage was jettisoned. During the\n    surface mission, the landed Helix antenna on the Lander deck\n    communicated with DSN via the orbiters Mars Express (MRO), Mars\n    Odyssey (ODY), and Mars Express  (MEX) every four to eight hours.\n \n    Other Lander systems included a single RAD6000 processor, a fault\n    detection and correction  system for monitoring spacecraft health, a\n    guidance system to land the spacecraft, a propulsion  system for\n    touchdown, a data handling system for committing critical data to\n    overnight storage during  surface operations, and a heater system to\n    ensure the spacecraft maintained an appropriate  temperature . The\n    Lander served as a host for various associated instrumentation,\n    including six  instrument packages: the Surface Stereo Imager (SSI),\n    Robotic Arm (RA) and associated Icy Soil  Acquisition Device (ISAD),\n    the Robotic Arm Camera (RAC), the Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and\n    Conductivity Analyzer (MECA), the Thermal Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA),\n    and the Meteorological  Package (MET) [SMITHETAL2008].\n \n    During most of Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), Phoenix used a UHF\n    antenna that wrapped around  the backshell to give it a wide field of\n    view (FOV) for  communications. During terminal descent (approximately\n    30 seconds before landing), the Lander switched to the landed Helix\n    antenna  and continued transmitting a UHF signal until one minute\n    after  landing. This wide FOV was  necessary as the geometry between\n    Phoenix and the orbiters MRO, ODY, and MEX  required a very wide\n    spread of off-boresight angles.\n \n    Following its soft touchdown between 65 deg N to 72 deg N latitude,\n    and after waiting 20 minutes for the dust to settle, the Lander\n    performed a number of critical activities. These 'Sol 0' (a sol is  a\n    mars day) activities included deployments of the landed solar  arrays,\n    the bio-barrier covering the RA, and the SSI and MET  masts. The SSI\n    took images of the bio-barrier, solar arrays,  and part of the footpad\n    and workspace. High priority EDL and Sol  0 data were saved to flash\n    memory within the first hour after  touchdown, after which the Lander\n    went to sleep to conserve  energy. The Lander woke up for 10 minutes\n    for the first  post-landed UHF communication pass one ODY or MRO orbit\n    period  (approximately 2 hours) after landing. After relaying data to\n    the orbiters during that first pass, the  Lander went to sleep again.\n    Payload heaters were on  continuously from touchdown, with Lander\n    heaters kicking in  around midnight for 4-5 hours of keep-alive\n    heating.  [GUINNETAL2008]\n \n  Lander on the Surface of Mars\n  =============================\n    The first seven sols after Landing were known as the  characterization\n    phase, with pre-planned activities running from  a minimum of 3 hours\n    on Sol 1 to a maximum of 6.5 hours on Sol 6  (the Lander was active\n    for up to 7 hours during the nominal surface  or digging phase). The\n    performance of the spacecraft's power, thermal, and UHF subsystems\n    were thoroughly characterized during  this phase, and TEGA, MECA, and\n    MET instruments went through their initial checkouts and  prepared for\n    nominal operations. Concurrent with  these activities, the EDL and Sol\n    0 data that were stored in the  non-volatile (flash memory) were\n    relayed to the ground. The SSI  imaged as much of the Lander as it\n    could see and characterized  the workspace and surrounding\n    environment. The  RAC located on the 'wrist' of the RA was  used to\n    image the footpads and the TEGA cover, as it was the only  imager that\n    could be maneuvered into the proper viewpoint for these  pictures.\n \n    After the Robotic Arm (RA) was checked out, the digging phase\n    commenced. The digging phase activities included digging a trench  in\n    front of the Lander, and the analysis of soil samples at  various\n    trench-depths by the Lander instruments. This phase  continued until\n    the End-of-Mission on Sol 90. Operations during  this phase were\n    conducted at the University of Arizona.\n \n    The Lander operated for 152 sols and achieved all scientific\n    objectives.\n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n    by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n    Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n    Administration (NASA).\n \n    The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n    communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n    solar system.  To carry out this function it is equipped with\n    high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,\n    and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n    The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n    equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at\n    Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,\n    Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of\n    the complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the\n    third is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n    Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their\n    diameters, construction, or operational characteristics:\n    70-m diameter, standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m\n    diameter (HEF), and 34-m beam waveguide (BWG).\n \n    For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].\n \n  Instrument Host Overview - 2001 Mars Odyssey\n  ============================================\n    The 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY) spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin\n    Astronautics (LMA).  Most spacecraft systems were redundant\n    in order to provide backup should a device fail.  In addition\n    to transmitting data collected by ODY instruments and systems,\n    the telecommunications system was used to relay data from Mars\n    surface assets and measure their relative motion radiometrically\n    in the 400 MHz frequency range.

Those data were then to be\n    relayed via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep\n    Space Network (DSN) on the ground.  Radio Science experiments\n    (such as radio tracking of the spacecraft and bistatic radio\n    scattering experiments) required that DSN hardware also\n    participate in data acquisition.  The following sections provide\n    an overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground\n    system as both supported Mars Observer science activities.\n \n    Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n    =====================================\n \n      The Mars Observer spacecraft provided a stabilized,\n      nadir-oriented platform for continuous observations of Mars by\n      an advanced set of science instruments.However, communication\n      with the spacecraft was lost three days before it was scheduled\n      to enter Mars orbit in late August 1993.  Only data from\n      Earth-Mars cruise and a very small amount of distant-encounter\n      Mars data were obtained from Mars Observer.\n \n      The spacecraft contract was originally won by the RCA\n      Astro-Space Division (ASD), which subsequently became the\n      General Electric Astro-Space Division when the two companies\n      merged.  The selection of RCA was intended to make maximum use\n      of existing designs and technologies from DMSP/TIROS weather\n      satellites and Satcom-K communication satellites.  General\n      Electric sold ASD to Martin Marietta Corporation at about the\n      time Mars Observer was launched; Martin Marietta was the prime\n      contractor when the spacecraft was lost.\n \n      The dimensions of the rectangular bus were 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.1 m in\n      the x-y-z dimensions.  When fully deployed, the six-panel solar\n      array was 7.0 x 3.7 meters, and would have developed over a\n      kilowatt of power at Mars.  The mass of the spacecraft was\n      about 1028 kg, including 166 kg of payload but excluding the\n      approximately 1346 kg of propellant required, most of which was\n      intended for orbit insertion and orbit circularization at Mars.\n      The propellant also included 63 kg of hydrazine, which would\n      have been used for spacecraft control during mapping.\n \n      At launch (25 September 1992), the solar panels and high-gain\n      antenna were folded against the rectangular bus and the two\n      science booms (Magnetometer and Gamma-Ray Spectrometer) were\n      retracted.  During early cruise the partially-deployed\n      spacecraft was stabilized in a controlled 0.01-rpm roll about\n      the y-axis; communications were conducted with Earth via a\n      low-gain antenna.  For trajectory correction and orbit\n      insertion maneuvers the spacecraft was oriented under three-\n      axis control and then returned to cruise attitude.\n \n      In its mapping orbit, Mars Observer was to be controlled in\n      three axes, using its horizon sensors to point the science\n      instruments on the +Z face toward the nadir.  The six-panel\n      solar-array was to be fully deployed on a boom to track the Sun\n      during each orbit, and the high-gain antenna boom was to be\n      fully deployed to track the Earth around each orbit.\n \n      Spacecraft pointing control was provided by four reaction\n      wheels.  Attitude information during mapping was to be provided\n      by a Mars horizon sensor that defined the nadir direction, a\n      star-mapper for inertial attitude, gyros and accelerometers for\n      measuring angular rates and linear accelerations, and multiple\n      sun sensors.  The spacecraft was required to maintain adequate\n      pointing control and to provide sufficient telemetry to allow\n      reconstruction of the pointing after each orbit.  The telemetry\n      stream provided data from the sensors sufficient to\n      characterize nadir and high-gain antenna pointing to within +/-\n      3 mrad (per axis, 3 sigma) and boom-mounted science instrument\n      pointing to within +/- 25 mrad (per axis, 3 sigma).\n \n      Two independent propulsion systems were provided.  All major\n      maneuvers, both in cruise and during orbit insertion, were to\n      be accomplished by a hypergolic, bipropellant system.  A\n      hydrazine system was available for orbit trim maneuvers during\n      the mapping period and some attitude control functions,\n      including unloading of the momentum wheels.  The hydrazine\n      thrusters were chosen to minimize contamination of the\n      instruments during the mapping period.\n \n      Most instruments were rigidly mounted on a nadir-pointing\n      spacecraft panel and, in general, provided simultaneous views\n      of the same nadir area.  No movable scan platform was provided;\n      the spacecraft was to be continuously pointed toward nadir,\n      rotating at the orbital rate.  Those instruments that required\n      scanning or multiple fields of view were constructed with\n      internal scanning mechanisms.  The Gamma Ray Spectrometer and\n      Magnetometer sensor assemblies were mounted on individual booms\n      on the spacecraft.  The steerable high-gain antenna (used for\n      radio science) was mounted on a third boom.\n \n      For more information regarding the Mars Observer spacecraft,\n      see [ALBEE&PALLUCONI1990]\n \n \n    Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n    ==============================\n      The Mars Observer Radio Science investigations utilized\n      instrumentation with elements both on the spacecraft and at the\n      NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this is shared\n      equipment, being used for routine telecommunications as well as\n      for Radio Science.\n \n      The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n      by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n      Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n      Administration.\n \n      The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n      communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n      solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN is equipped\n      with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and\n      receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n      The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n      equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at\n      Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,\n      Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the\n      complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the\n      third is in the southern hemisphere.\n \n      The network comprises four subnets, each of which includes one\n      antenna at each complex.  The four subnets are defined\n      according to the properties of their respective antennas: 70-m\n      diameter, standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m\n      diameter, and 26-m diameter.\n \n      These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications\n      subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft, constitute the major\n      elements of instrumentation for radio science investigations.\n \n      For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].","image_url":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/web/mars_observer.jpg","tools":[]},{"tags":["Orbiter"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.mgs","display_name":"Mars Global Surveyor","display_description":"Instrument Host Overview\n    ========================\n      For most Mars Global Surveyor experiments, data were collected\n      by instruments on the spacecraft.

The following sections\n      provide an overview first of the spacecraft and then of the\n      DSN ground system as both supported Mars Global Surveyor\n      science activities.\n \n \n    Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n    =====================================\n      The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft was built by\n      Lockheed Martin Astronautics (LMA).  The spacecraft structure\n      included four subassemblies: the equipment module, the\n      propulsion module, the solar array support structure, and the\n      high-gain antenna (HGA) support structure.\n \n      The equipment module housed the avionics packages and science\n      instruments.  Its dimensions were 1.221 x 1.221 x 0.762 meters\n      in X, Y, and Z, respectively.  With the exception of the\n      Magnetometer, all of the science instruments were bolted to\n      the nadir equipment deck, mounted above the equipment module on\n      the +Z panel.  The Mars Relay antenna was the tallest\n      instrument rising 1.115 meters above the nadir equipment deck.\n \n      Inside, two identical computers orchestrated almost all of\n      the spacecraft's flight activities.  Although only one of the\n      two units controlled Surveyor at any one time, identical\n      software ran concurrently in the backup unit in case of an\n      emergency.  Each computer consisted of a Marconi 1750A\n      microprocessor, 128 Kbytes of RAM for storage, and 20 Kbytes\n      of ROM that contained code to run basic survival routines in\n      the event that the computers experienced a reset.\n \n      Additional storage for science and spacecraft health data\n      was provided by two solid-state recorders with a combined\n      capacity of 375 megabytes.  Mars Global Surveyor was NASA's\n      first planetary spacecraft to use RAM exclusively (instead of\n      a tape recorder) for mass data storage.  This technological\n      improvement reduced operational complexity and cost.\n \n      The equipment module also housed three 'reaction wheels'\n      mounted at right angles to each other.  By transferring angular\n      momentum to and from the rapidly spinning reaction wheels, MGS\n      flight computers could control the spacecraft attitude to high\n      precision.  A fourth reaction wheel, mounted in a direction\n      skewed to the other three, provided redundancy and backup.\n \n      Sun sensors were placed at several locations about the\n      spacecraft.  They provided basic information on spacecraft\n      attitude -- namely, a rough vector toward the Sun.  Their\n      primary use was during attitude reinitialization after a\n      spacecraft anomaly.\n \n      The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) contained gyroscopes\n      and accelerometers to measure angular rates and linear\n      accelerations.  Angular rate measurements were used to\n      determine yaw attitude during the Mapping Phase.  The IMU\n      also provided inertial attitude control, as might be\n      required during maneuvers.\n \n      The Mars Horizon Sensor Assembly (MHSA) determined the horizon\n      as seen from the spacecraft; from this, an empirical nadir\n      could be derived for pointing the science instruments.  The\n      MHSA was mounted to the +Z panel of the equipment module, next\n      to the science instruments.\n \n      The Celestial Sensor Assembly (CSA) complemented the IMU by\n      providing attitude data based on determination of positions\n      of known stars.  It was used during the Cruise Phase and Orbit\n      Insertion Phase for both attitude determination and control.\n      It was also used when precise attitude knowledge was required\n      during the Mapping Phase.  The CSA was mounted to the +Z panel\n      of the equipment module, next to the science instruments.\n \n      The propulsion module contained the propellant tanks, main\n      engines, propulsion feed system and attitude control\n      thrusters.  It was a rectangular box 1.063 meters on a side\n      and was bolted to the equipment module on the latter's -Z\n      panel.  The propulsion module also served as the adaptor to\n      the launch vehicle.\n \n      Propulsion was provided by a dual mode bi-propellant system\n      using nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and hydrazine.  This dual mode\n      differed from conventional bi-propellant systems in that the\n      hydrazine was used by both the main engine and the attitude\n      control thrusters, rather than having separate hydrazine\n      tanks for each.  The main engine was the only one that used\n      the bi-propellant system.  The main engine maximum thrust\n      was 659 N.  It was used for major maneuvers including large\n      trajectory corrections during Cruise, Mars orbit injection\n      (MOI), and transfer to the Mapping orbit (TMO).\n \n      Four rocket engine modules (REM), each containing three 4.45 N\n      thrusters, were provided.  Each REM contained two aft-facing\n      thrusters and one roll control thruster.  Four of the eight\n      aft-facing thrusters were used for the smaller trajectory\n      corrections during Cruise and for Orbit Trim Maneuvers (OTM)\n      during Mapping; they could also be used for attitude control\n      during main engine burns.  Two sets of four thrusters were on\n      redundant strings so that one string could be isolated in the\n      event of a failure.  Four thrusters were provided for\n      attitude control.  In addition to their role during maneuvers,\n      the 4.45 N thrusters were also used for momentum management.\n \n      MGS carried about 385 kg of propellant; nearly 75 percent of\n      that was used during MOI.\n \n      Two solar arrays, each 3.53 meters long by 1.85 meters wide\n      provided power.  Each array was mounted close to the top of\n      the propulsion module on the +Y and -Y panels and near the\n      interface between the propulsion and equipment modules.\n      Including the adaptor that held the array to the propulsion\n      module, the tip of each array was designed to stand 4.270\n      meters from the side of the spacecraft.  During initial\n      deployment, the -Y solar array yoke was damaged leaving its\n      exact position and orientation in some doubt (and leading to\n      several changes in mission design).  Rectangular, metal\n      'drag flaps' were mounted to the end of each array; these\n      flaps increased the total surface area of the structure and\n      added another 0.813 meters to the overall dimensions.\n      Between each array and flap was mounted a magnetometer sensor.\n \n      Each array consisted of two panels, an inner and outer panel,\n      comprised of gallium arsenide and silicon solar cells,\n      respectively.  During mapping operations at Mars, the amount\n      of power produced by the arrays varied from a high of 980\n      Watts at perihelion to a low of 660 Watts at aphelion.\n \n      While in orbit around Mars, the solar arrays provided\n      power as MGS flew over the day side of the planet.  When\n      the spacecraft passed over the night side, energy flowed\n      from two nickel-hydrogen (NiH2) batteries, each with a\n      capacity of about 20 Amp-hours.  Eclipses lasted from 36 to\n      41 minutes per orbit; depth of battery discharge was limited\n      to 27% except during emergencies.\n \n      The high-gain antenna structure was also bolted to the\n      outside of the propulsion module.  When fully deployed, the\n      1.5-meter diameter antenna sat at the end of a 2-meter boom\n      which was mounted to the +X panel of the propulsion module.\n      Two rotating joints (gimbals) held the antenna to the boom\n      and allowed the antenna to track and point at Earth while\n      the science instruments observed Mars.\n \n      One of the two main functions of the HGA was to receive\n      command sequences sent by the flight operations\n      team on Earth.  During command periods, data flowed to MGS\n      at rates in multiples of two from 7.8125 bits per second\n      (emergency rate) to 500 bits per second (750 commands per\n      minute); the nominal rate was 125 bits per second.\n \n      The other main function of the HGA was to send data back\n      to Earth.  All transmissions from MGS utilized an X-band\n      radio link near 8.4 gigahertz.  The transmitted power was\n      about 25 watts.  Data rates as high as 85333 bits per second\n      were used.\n \n      The spacecraft was also equipped with four low-gain antennas\n      (LGA), two for transmit and two for receive.  The LGAs were\n      used in Inner Cruise, during special events such as maneuvers,\n      during aerobraking, and for emergency communications following\n      a spacecraft anomaly.\n \n      The primary transmitting low-gain antenna (LGT1) was mounted\n      on the traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) enclosure, which\n      was mounted on the rim of the HGA reflector; its boresight\n      was aligned with the HGA boresight, which was in the +X\n      direction until HGA deployment.  The backup (LGT2) was also\n      mounted on the TWTA enclosure.  LGT2 boresight was aligned\n      at a cant angle approximately 160 degrees away from the\n      shared boresights of the HGA and LGT1.  This angle was chosen\n      to minimize the consequences of a gimbal failure once\n      articulation commenced after deployment of the HGA boom in\n      mapping orbit.  LGT2 was not used prior to HGA deployment\n      because its orientation and proximity to the nadir payload\n      deck would lead to irradiation of the payload instruments\n      while the HGA was in its stowed position.  One receiving LGA\n      (LGR) was mounted on the -X panel of the equipment module;\n      the other was on the +X side of the propulsion module.\n \n      The spacecraft was equipped with an experimental Ka-band\n      downlink radio system.  The transmitter converted the X-band\n      signal to 32 Ghz and amplified it to about 0.5 watts; the\n      Ka-band output was radiated through the HGA.\n \n      The spacecraft +Z axis vector was normal to the nadir equipment\n      deck; the main engine was aimed in the -Z direction.  The -X\n      axis vector was in the direction of the velocity vector during\n      nominal Mapping (e.g., May 1999).  +X was in the direction of\n      the HGA boresight during Cruise, and the HGA boom was mounted to\n      the +X panel of the propulsion module.  The +Y axis completed an\n      orthogonal rectangular coordinate system.  The +/-Y axes defined\n      generally the deployment directions of the solar panels.  The\n      solar cells themselves were on the -Z sides of the panels.\n \n      There were three levels of anomaly response in the spacecraft\n      flight software.  The first, emergency mode, was entered in\n      response to a command-loss timeout.  Entry into emergency mode\n      reconfigured the telecom subsystem to its lowest data rate\n      settings to enhance the chances of successful contact from\n      Earth.  After a programmable period of time in emergency mode,\n      the spacecraft transitioneds to contingency mode.\n \n      Contingency mode was entered by four paths: failure to regain\n      contact with Earth while in emergency mode, power-related faults\n      such as gimbal faults and low battery state of charge, loss of\n      inertial reference, and explicit ground command.  Contingency\n      mode sets telecom rates to their minimum values, turneds off\n      non-essential power loads (including the payload), disableds\n      stored sequences not explicitly specified as enabled for this\n      mode, and changeds the spacecraft attitude to sun-coning to\n      optimize power and communications.\n \n      Safe mode was the deepest level of anomaly response.  It couldan be\n      be entered by three paths: failures of key spacecraft components\n      that could cannot be corrected by normal fault protection, power-on\n      reset of both Spacecraft Control Processors (SCPs), or explicit\n      ground command.  The response to safe mode entry was similar to\n      that of contingency mode.  Safe mode program code for the SCP was\n      executed from Programmable Read-Only-Memory (PROM).\n \n      For more information on the spacecraft and mission see\n      [JPLD-12088].\n \n \n    Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n    ==============================\n      The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n      by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n      Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n      Administration (NASA).\n \n      The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n      communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n      solar system.  To carry out this function it is equipped with\n      high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,\n      and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n      The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n      equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at\n      Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,\n      Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).

An engine section in the Delta first\n      stage housed the Rocketdyne RS-27 main engine and two\n      Rocketdyne LR101-NA-11 vernier engines.  The vernier engines\n      provided roll control during main engine burn, and attitude\n      control after main engine cutoff and before second stage\n      separation.  The RS-27 main engine was a single start, liquid\n      bi-propellant rocket engine which provided approximately\n      894,094 N of thrust at lift off.  The first stage propellant\n      load (96,000 kg) consisted of RP-1 fuel (thermally stable\n      kerosene) and liquid oxygen as an oxidizer.  The RP-1 fuel tank\n      and liquid oxygen tank were separated by a center body section\n      that housed control electronics, ordnance sequencing equipment,\n      a telemetry system, and a rate gyro.  First stage thrust\n      augmentation was provided by nine solid-propellant Graphite\n      Epoxy Motors (GEMs), each fueled with 12,000 kg of\n      hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene solid propellant.  Each GEM\n      provided an average thrust of 439,796 N at lift off.  The main\n      engine, vernier engines, and six of the GEMs were ignited at\n      lift off.  The remaining three GEMs were ignited in flight.\n      The GEMs were jettisoned from the first stage after motor\n      burnout.\n \n      The interstage assembly extended from the top of the first\n      stage to the second stage mini-skirt.  This assembly carried\n      loads to the first stage, and contained an exhaust vent and six\n      spring driven separation rods.\n \n      The Delta II 7925 second stage propulsion system included a\n      restartable, liquid bi-propellant Aerojet AJ10-118K engine that\n      consumed Aerozine 50 fuel (a 50/50 mix of hydrazine and\n      asymmetric dimethyl hydrazine) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4).\n      Since Aerozine 50 and nitrogen tetroxide are hypergolic, no\n      catalyst or igniter in the engine thrust chamber was required.\n      The second stage had a total propellant load of 6000 kg and\n      provided a thrust of 42,000 N.  Gaseous helium was used for\n      pressurization, and a nitrogen cold gas jet system provided\n      attitude control during coast periods and roll control during\n      powered flight.  Hydraulically activated gimbals provided pitch\n      and yaw control.  The forward section of the second stage\n      housed the guidance and control equipment that provided\n      guidance sequencing and stabilization signals for both the\n      first and second stages.  Both first and second stages had a\n      battery driven DC power system.  Separate batteries were used\n      for the guidance and control system, ordnance, and engine\n      systems.  The instrumentation and flight termination system\n      were powered by the same battery.\n \n      The Payload Assist Module D (PAM-D) was the third stage of the\n      Delta II 7925 launch vehicle and provided the final velocity\n      required to place the Pathfinder spacecraft on a trajectory to\n      Mars.  The PAM-D upper stage consisted of (1) a spin table to\n      support, rotate, and stabilize the Pathfinder spacecraft /\n      PAM-D combination before separating from the second stage, (2)\n      a Star-48B solid rocket motor for propulsion, (3) an active\n      Nutation Control System (NCS) to provide stability after\n      spin-up of the spacecraft/PAM-D stack, (4) a 3717C payload\n      attach fitting to mount the Star-48B motor to the spacecraft,\n      and (5) a yo-yo de-spin system designed to decrease the spin\n      rate of the upper stage / spacecraft stack from 70 RPM to 12\n      +/- 2 RPM.  The Star-48B provided an average thrust of 67,168 N\n      and was fueled with 2000 kg of solid propellant that was\n      composed primarily of ammonium perchlorate and aluminum.\n \n      During launch and ascent through the sensible atmosphere, the\n      Pathfinder spacecraft / PAM-D upper stage combination was\n      protected from aerodynamic forces by a 2.9 m diameter payload\n      fairing.  The payload fairing was jettisoned from the launch\n      vehicle during second stage powered flight at a minimum\n      altitude of 111 km.\n \n \n    Flight System Description\n    -------------------------\n      The Mars Pathfinder Flight System consisted of six major\n      subsystems: Attitude and Information Management (AIM);\n      Telecommunications; Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL); Power\n      and Pyrotechnics; Propulsion; and Mechanical Structure.  Brief\n      descriptions of the subsystems are given below.\n \n \n    Mechanical Structure\n    --------------------\n      The Mars Pathfinder flight system was effectively three\n      spacecraft in one.  The flight system was a standard\n      interplanetary spacecraft in one mode, an atmospheric entry\n      vehicle in another, and a surface lander in the third.  The\n      major components of the spacecraft were the cruise stage, the\n      entry vehicle (consisting of the heatshield, backshell, and\n      attached hardware), and the lander (containing the rover).\n      Components from all other subsystems were distributed through\n      each of these elements.\n \n      The purpose of the lander was to provide engineering support to\n      the science instruments and rover during surface operations.\n      The landing approach employed by Mars Pathfinder required the\n      lander to have self righting capability.  A simple tetrahedron\n      design was developed to limit the possible landing\n      orientations.  The lander was able to right itself if it landed\n      on any face of the tetrahedron by driving actuators which\n      connected three faces of the tetrahedron (the petals) with the\n      fourth (the base petal).  All thermally sensitive electronics\n      were contained in the insulated Integrated Support Assembly\n      (ISA) located inside the tetrahedron.  This enclosure provided\n      a controlled environment to minimize the effects of the extreme\n      temperature variations on Mars.  The lander high gain antenna\n      and low gain antenna were attached to the outside of the ISA,\n      as was the Imager for Mars Pathfinder.  The rover was attached\n      to one of the side petals.\n \n      A detailed description of the entry vehicle is given in the\n      following EDL subsystem description.  The cruise stage was\n      responsible for controlling the vehicle during cruise, and was\n      home to most of the components required for interplanetary\n      flight.  These included launch vehicle separation devices;\n      attitude sensors; propulsive thrusters, tanks, and other\n      equipment; cruise antennas; and solar arrays.  The cruise stage\n      was jettisoned prior to entry into the Martian atmosphere and\n      impacted the surface.  To eliminate duplication of\n      capabilities, cruise stage hardware utilized key\n      telecommunications, attitude and information management\n      services, and power support from equipment that resided on the\n      lander.  As a result, there was a significant umbilical\n      extending between the lander and cruise stage.\n \n \n    Entry, Descent, and Landing Subsystem\n    -------------------------------------\n      The Entry, Descent, and Landing subsystem was responsible for\n      safely placing the lander on the surface of Mars.  In order to\n      do this, the velocity had to be reduced from the initial entry\n      velocity of 7.6 km/s to a level that limited the maximum\n      landing shock to less than 40 g's.  Specific components of the\n      system required to do this included a 2.65 meter diameter\n      aeroshell, accelerometers, a parachute, an incremental bridle,\n      retrorockets, airbags, and a radar altimeter.\n \n      The aeroshell was used to reduce the velocity of the vehicle\n      from 7.6 km/s to .370 km/s, removing over 99% of the initial\n      kinetic energy and protecting the lander against the resultant\n      extreme aerodynamic heating.  The heatshield was a\n      Viking-heritage, 70 degree half angle blunt cone.  Thermal\n      protection was provided by Viking-heritage SLA-561V ablative\n      material.  Ablative material was also applied to the backshell\n      to protect the lander from the effects of recirculation flow\n      around the entry vehicle.  During the entry and descent phases,\n      accelerometers on the lander provided parachute deployment\n      timing information and acceleration data.  A 12.7 meter\n      diameter Viking heritage disk-gap-band parachute was used for\n      terminal descent.  The parachute was designed to open at\n      supersonic speeds with a maximum deployment dynamic pressure of\n      700 N/m^2.\n \n      The EDL system also included separation devices designed to\n      separate the heatshield from the backshell after parachute\n      deployment.  The heatshield had to be separated and released\n      from the backshell so that the lander could be deployed on the\n      incremental bridle.  The incremental bridle was designed to\n      provide separation between the backshell-mounted retrorockets\n      and the lander and to improve stability during the rocket\n      firing.  A radar altimeter on the lander was used to determine\n      when to ignite the three retrorockets.  The retrorockets were\n      sized to bring the backshell/lander system to a complete stop\n      at approximately 15 m above the surface.  Four airbags attached\n      to the faces of the tetrahedral lander were inflated just\n      before the rockets fired and were designed to limit landing\n      loads to less than 40 Earth g's.  The airbags were inflated\n      using three gas generators in 1/4 of a second.  The generators\n      continued to maintain the pressure in the airbags for over one\n      minute past initial pressurization.  Just prior to contacting\n      the surface, cable cutters released the lander from the\n      parachute, backshell, and retrorockets.  The lander hit with a\n      vertical velocity of 12 m/s and a horizontal velocity of 6 m/s.\n      After ground impact and tumbling, the airbags deflated and were\n      retracted.  The three lander petals were then opened to\n      establish an upright configuration on the surface.\n \n      All of the details of the timing for the entire EDL procedure\n      were determined in real time on board the spacecraft.\n \n \n    Attitude and Information Management Subsystem\n    ---------------------------------------------\n      The AIM subsystem performed all spacecraft computing functions\n      including command and telemetry handling, HGA pointing, payload\n      data compression, cruise attitude determination and control,\n      and EDL timing.  This subsystem was built around a single\n      high-performance (20 MIPS), 32-bit, single-board R6000\n      computer.  The computer had 128 Mbyte of dynamic RAM for flight\n      software, engineering measurements, and science data.  An\n      additional 4 Mbytes of electronically erasable PROM was\n      included to hold flight software boot code, critical sequences\n      and data.  The speed and capabilities of this computer greatly\n      simplified both software development and mission operations.\n \n      Internal interfaces within AIM were implemented using a VME bus\n      backplane.  Major VME interfaces included the Power &\n      Pyrotechnics subsystem, the Reed Solomon downlink board, the\n      hardware command decoder, and the power converter unit.  A\n      Mil-Std-1553 bus served for engineering data links to remote\n      engineering units which collected status data from the\n      celestial sensors and analog telemetry channels.  Celestial\n      sensors included a modified Magellan/IUS star scanner and a\n      five head sun sensor.  The spacecraft was spin stabilized\n      during cruise, and maintained an Earth point profile for most\n      of the flight (except for portions near Earth and Mars).  The\n      attitude determination and control system was required to\n      maintain at least 2 degrees inertial pointing throughout\n      cruise.  Attitude determination and HGA control was required\n      during the surface phase.  The autonomous pointing accuracy\n      requirement for the HGA was 3.5 degrees (note that more\n      accurate pointing was possible using downlink dithering).  The\n      AIM was also responsible for collecting and packetizing science\n      data from the instruments.\n \n      Flight software in the AIM controlled the uplink interface,\n      downlink telemetry, instrument control, engineering / science\n      data collection and formatting, bus control, sequence and\n      command processing, attitude determination / control, and power\n      / pyro functions.  The flight software design was coded in 'C'.\n      The operating system was an adaptation of VxWorks, a\n      commercially-available operating system for the R6000 computer.\n      The operating system provided a file system and an interprocess\n      communications protocol for flight software components.\n \n \n    Telecommunications Subsystem\n    ----------------------------\n      The Telecommunications subsystem provided communications\n      capability during cruise, EDL and surface operations and\n      support for radio navigation during cruise.  The baseline\n      design was a direct to Earth X-band system.  There were two\n      major elements to this subsystem: the Radio Frequency Subsystem\n      (RFS) and the Antenna Subsystem.  All RFS components were\n      located in the lander ISA.  Primary RFS functions were\n      performed by a single string Cassini transponder, a 13 watt\n      (RF) Solid State Power Amplifier, a newly developed Telemetry\n      Modulation Unit, and a Cassini Command Decoder Unit.  This\n      single string approach was designed to work for the duration of\n      the short Pathfinder mission, however, a partially redundant\n      backup downlink capability was also provided.  This backup\n      system included a small X-band transmitter with an integrated 5\n      W (RF) power amplifier and an additional TMU.  This backup\n      provided significantly less performance than the primary\n      system, but was designed to be sufficient to satisfy the\n      primary mission objectives in an emergency.\n \n      The Antenna Subsystem consisted of five antennas for cruise,\n      EDL and surface operations.  A waveguide connected the RFS in\n      the lander to a medium gain antenna (MGA) located on the cruise\n      stage.  A medium gain antenna was required to maintain a\n      minimum 20 b/s link through cruise.  The MGA was a standard\n      Mars Observer design.  Two antennas were provided for EDL\n      communications.  The backshell LGA was used during entry and\n      early parachute descent.  The EDL LGA was a whip antenna\n      attached to the top of the lander and was used during the final\n      portion of parachute descent.  Two antennas were provided on\n      the lander.  The principal antenna was a steerable high gain\n      antenna mounted on the ISA.  The HGA was a mechanically-steered\n      slotted plate with 2 degrees of freedom in pointing.  It\n      provided a nominal 125 b/s command uplink rate and a telemetry\n      downlink rate of approximately 600 b/s into a DSN 34-m antenna\n      (or 2700 b/s into a 70-m antenna).  These data rate\n      capabilities assumed 3.5 degrees pointing of the HGA.  Improved\n      pointing (using a dithering scheme with the DSN) could improve\n      these rates.  These rates were also conservative in that they\n      contained a 3 dB link margin.  A Low Gain Antenna was provided\n      for emergency situations in the event the HGA should fail.  The\n      LGA provided an emergency 7.8 b/s command uplink rate and a\n      minimum 40 b/s downlink rate over a 60 degree beam width.\n \n \n    Power and Pyrotechnics Subsystem\n    --------------------------------\n      The Power and Pyrotechnics Subsystem was responsible for\n      generating, storing and distributing power during cruise and\n      surface operations.  In addition, this subsystem was\n      responsible for controlling and initiating all pyrotechnic\n      devices required for EDL and surface operations.  Power was\n      generated during cruise by a 4.4 m^2 Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)\n      solar array which covered the top surface of the cruise stage.\n      The 5.5 mm thick cells were arranged to prevent any single\n      failures from catastrophically impacting the power output.\n      Power was generated on the surface by 2.9 m^2 of GaAs solar\n      arrays mounted on the exposed surfaces of the lander petals.\n      The lander and cruise stage used the same 5.5 mm thick cells.\n \n      A 40 amp-hr (~1120 W-hr @ 28 V) silver zinc battery was used to\n      provide energy storage during the mission.  Silver zinc\n      batteries are typically used in primary battery applications\n      (like launch vehicles), but Pathfinder re-qualified the\n      technology for use as a rechargeable battery.  The advantage of\n      this type of battery is a much higher energy density than\n      typical NiCd or NiH batteries.  The disadvantage is a\n      relatively short cycle life (limited to 30-100 cycles).  The\n      battery was only used to support launch, trajectory correction\n      maneuvers (TCMs) and surface operations, however, so the cycle\n      capability was sufficient for primary operations.\n \n      The power distribution system used an unregulated bus\n      controlled by a shunt regulator.  Pyro devices were initiated\n      using a secondary power distribution system (isolated from the\n      main) to prevent ground loop problems.  Because of the rapid\n      firing of pyros during EDL, special thermal batteries were\n      included as a backup power source for the pyro system.  The\n      pyro system was designed to provide sufficient arm and enable\n      controls to satisfy all system safety requirements.\n \n \n    Propulsion Subsystem\n    --------------------\n      The Propulsion subsystem included all equipment needed to\n      perform attitude control and TCM's during cruise and Rocket\n      Assisted Deceleration during EDL.  The cruise stage propulsion\n      system consisted of four blow-down hydrazine titanium\n      propellant tanks connected with eight 4.45 N (1 lb) thrusters\n      via series latch valves.  These thrusters were arranged to\n      allow coupled turns and both axial and transverse translational\n      maneuvers.

To carry out this function the DSN is equipped\n    with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,\n    and appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n    The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n    equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at\n    Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,\n    Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).

Its primary mission was to\n    determine microrover performance in the poorly understood\n    planetary terrain of Mars.  The microrover was delivered,\n    integrated with the Mars Pathfinder (MPF) Lander, to Mars on July\n    4, 1997.  After landing, the microrover was deployed from the\n    lander and began a nominal 7 sol mission, which was later\n    extended, to conduct technology experiments such as determining\n    wheel-soil interactions, autonomous navigation and hazard\n    avoidance capabilities, and engineering characterizations\n    (thermal control, power generation performance, etc.).  In\n    addition, the microrover carried an Alpha Proton X-ray\n    Spectrometer (APXS) which when deployed on rocks and soil\n    provided element composition.  Lastly, the microrover imaged the\n    lander to assist in status and damage assessment.\n \n \n    Mechanical, Thermal, and Mobility Subsystem\n    -------------------------------------------\n      The microrover is a 6-wheeled vehicle of a rocker bogie design\n      which allows the traverse of obstacles a wheel diameter (13 cm)\n      in size.  Each wheel is independently actuated and geared\n      (2000:1) providing superior climbing capability in soft sand.\n      The front and rear wheels are independently steerable,\n      providing the capability for the vehicle to turn in place.  The\n      vehicle has a top speed of 0.4 m/min.\n \n      Microrover components not designed to survive ambient Mars\n      temperatures (-110 degrees Celsius during a Martian night) are\n      contained in the warm electronics box (WEB).  The WEB is\n      insulated, coated with high and low emissivity paints, and\n      heated with a combination of 3, 1W RHUs, resistive heating\n      under computer control during the day and waste heat produced\n      by the electronics.  This design allows the WEB to maintain\n      components between -40 and +40 degrees Celsius during a Martian\n      day.\n \n \n      Control and Navigation Subsystem\n      --------------------------------- Control is provided by an\n      integrated set of computing and power distribution electronics.\n      The computer is an 80C85 rated at 100 Kips which uses, in a 16\n      Kbyte page swapping fashion, 176 Kbytes of PROM and 576 Kbytes\n      of RAM.  The computer performs I/O to some 70 sensor channels\n      and services such devices as the cameras, modem, motors and\n      experiment electronics.\n \n      Vehicle motion control is accomplished through the on/off\n      switching of the drive or steering motors.  An average of motor\n      encoder (drive) or potentiometer (steering) readings determines\n      when to switch off the motors.  When motors are off, the\n      computer conducts a proximity and hazard detection function,\n      using its laser striping and camera system to determine the\n      presence of obstacles in its path.  The vehicle is steered\n      autonomously to avoid obstacles but continues to achieve the\n      commanded goal location.  While stopped, the computer also\n      updates its measurement of distance traveled and heading using\n      the averaged odometry and on-board gyro.  This provides an\n      estimate of progress to the goal location.\n \n \n    Power Generation and Distribution\n    ---------------------------------\n      The microrover is powered by a 0.22 sqare meter solar panel\n      comprised of 13 strings of 18, 5.5 mil GaAs cells each.  The\n      solar panel is backed up by 9 LiSOCL2 D-cell sized primary\n      batteries, providing up to 150 W-hr.  This combined\n      panel/batteries system allows microrover power users to draw up\n      to 30W of peak power (mid-sol) while the peak panel production\n      is 16 W.  The normal driving power requirement for the\n      microrover is 10 W.\n \n \n    Radio Communications\n    --------------------\n      Command and telemetry is provided by modems on the microrover\n      and lander.  The microrover is the link commander of this 1/2\n      duplex, UHF system.  During the day, the microrover regularly\n      requests transmission of any commands sent from Earth and\n      stored on the lander.  When commands are not available, the\n      microrover transmits any telemetry collected during the last\n      interval between communication sessions.  The telemetry\n      received by the lander from the microrover is stored and\n      forwarded to the earth the same as any lander telemetry.  In\n      addition, this communication system is used to provide a\n      'heartbeat' signal during vehicle driving.  While stopped, the\n      microrover sends a signal to the lander.  Once acknowledged by\n      the lander, the microrover proceeds to the next stopping point\n      along its traverse.\n \n      Commands for the microrover are generated and analysis of\n      telemetry is performed at the microrover control station, a\n      Silicon Graphics workstation which is a part of the MPF ground\n      control operation.  At the end of each sol of microrover\n      traverse, the camera system on the lander takes a stereo image\n      of the vehicle in the terrain.  Those images, portions of a\n      terrain panorama and supporting images from the microrover\n      cameras, are displayed at the control station.  The operator is\n      able to designate on the display points in the terrain which\n      will serve as goal locations for the microrover traverse.  The\n      coordinates of these points are transferred into a file\n      containing the commands for execution by the microrover on the\n      next sol.  In addition, the operator can use a model which,\n      when overlayed on the image of the vehicle, measures the\n      location and heading of the vehicle.  This information is also\n      transfered into the command file to be sent to the microrover\n      on the next sol to correct any navigation errors.  This command\n      file is incorporated into the lander command stream and is sent\n      by the MPF ground control to the lander, earmarked for\n      transmission to the microrover upon request.\n \n      For more information on the Microrover Flight Experiment, see\n      the papers [MATIJEVIC1994] and [MATIJEVICETAL1997A].\n \n      Copyright 1996, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute\n      of Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space\n      Administration.","tools":[3,4]},{"tags":["Orbiter"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.ody","display_name":"Mars Odyssey","display_description":"Instrument Host Overview\n  ========================\n    For most Mars Odyssey experiments, data were collected by\n    instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed\n    via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space\n    Network (DSN) on the ground.  Radio Science observations (such\n    as radio tracking) required that DSN hardware also participate\n    in data acquisition.  The following sections provide an\n    overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground\n    system as both supported Mars Odyssey science activities.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft\n  =====================================\n    The Mars Odyssey spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin\n    Astronautics (LMA).  The spacecraft structure was divided into\n    two modules: the equipment module and the propulsion module.\n    The shape was not uniform, but can be approximated by\n    envisioning a box 2.2 x 1.7 x 2.6 meters.  The framework was\n    composed of aluminum and titanium.  Most spacecraft systems\n    were redundant in order to provide backup should a device fail.\n    For more information, see [JPLD-16303].\n \n    Command and Data Handling\n    -------------------------\n      This subsystem handled all computing functions for Mars\n      Odyssey.  It ran the flight software and controlled the\n      spacecraft through interface electronics.  The system was\n      based around a RAD6000 computer with 128 megabytes of\n      random access memory (RAM) and 3 megabytes non-volatile\n      memory, which allowed data to be maintained by the system\n      in the event of a power failure.  The interface\n      electronics were computer cards that communicated with\n      external peripherals.  The cards fit into the computer's\n      main board.  There were two identical sets of the\n      computer and interface electronics for back up in case\n      one failed.  One card was not redundant.  It was a one\n      gigabyte mass memory card that was used to store imaging\n      data.\n \n    Telecommunications\n    ------------------\n      The telecommunication subsystem was composed of two parts.\n      The first was a radio system that operated in the X-band\n      microwave frequency range.  It was used for communications\n      between Earth and the spacecraft.  The other system operated\n      in the ultra high frequency (UHF) range for communications\n      between future Mars landers and Odyssey.\n \n      Communication between the spacecraft and Earth occurred\n      through the use of three antennas.  The high-gain antenna was\n      a dish with 1.3 meter diameter (4.25 feet).  It was used\n      during the late Cruise and Science and relay phases of the\n      mission when data rates were high.  It simultaneously\n      received commands from Earth and transmitted science data to\n      Earth.  The medium-gain antenna was a 7.1 cm (2.8 inch) wide\n      rectangular horn antenna that protruded through the high-gain\n      dish.  The low-gain antenna was 4.4 cm (1.75 inches) and\n      provided wide- angle communications in emergencies or when\n      the high-gain antenna was not pointed directly at Earth.\n \n    Electrical Power\n    ----------------\n      A 7 square meter (75 square feet) solar panel containing an\n      array of gallium arsenide cells generated power for the\n      spacecraft.  The power distribution and drive unit sent power\n      to the electrical loads of the spacecraft through a system of\n      switches.\n \n    Guidance, Navigation and Control\n    --------------------------------\n      This subsystem used three redundant pairs of sensors to\n      determine the spacecraft's attitude.  A star camera was used\n      to look at star fields and a sun sensor detected the position\n      of the Sun in order to back up the star camera.  The inertial\n      measurement unit collected spacecraft orientation data\n      between star camera updates.  The reaction wheels along with\n      the thrusters operated to control the attitude.  There were\n      four reaction wheels - three primary and one for backup.\n      Odyssey was a three-axis stabilized spacecraft.\n \n    Propulsion\n    ----------\n      The propulsion system comprised a main engine, which aided in\n      placing Odyssey in orbit around Mars, and sets of small\n      thrusters, which performed attitude control and trajectory\n      correction maneuvers.  The main engine produced a thrust of\n      about 695 Newtons (156 pounds of force).  Each of the four\n      attitude controlling thrusters produced a thrust of 0.9\n      Newtons (0.2 pounds of force) and the four spacecraft turning\n      thrusters produced a force of 22 Newtons (5 pounds of force).\n      The propulsion system also included one gaseous helium tank\n      used to pressurize the fuel and oxidizer tanks, miscellaneous\n      tubing, pyro valves, and filters.\n \n    Structures\n    ----------\n      The spacecraft was composed of two modules - propulsion and\n      equipment.  The propulsion module contained tanks, thrusters,\n      and associated plumbing.  The equipment module consisted of\n      the equipment deck, which supported the Mars Radiation\n      Environment Experiment (MARIE), and engineering components.\n      The other component of the equipment module was the science\n      deck which housed the Thermal Emission Imaging System\n      (THEMIS), Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), High-Energy Neutron\n      Detector (HEND), Neutron Spectrometer (NS), and star cameras\n      on top and engineering components and the GRS central\n      electronics box on the underside.\n \n    Thermal Control\n    ---------------\n      A combination of heaters, radiators, louvers, blankets, and\n      thermal coatings maintained each spacecraft component's\n      temperature within its allowable limits.\n \n    Mechanisms\n    ----------\n      Odyssey functioned via several mechanisms, many of which were\n      associated with the high-gain antenna.  The antenna was\n      locked down during launch, cruise, and aerobraking through\n      three 'retention and release devices,' or latches.  The\n      antenna was released and deployed with a motor-driven hinge\n      once the science orbit around Mars was attained. A two-axis\n      gimbal assembly controlled the position of the antenna. The\n      solar array used four latches which folded together and\n      locked down the panels during launch.  After deployment, a\n      two-axis gimbal assembly controlled the solar array.  The\n      last mechanism was a latch for the deployment of the 6-meter\n      GRS boom.\n \n    Flight Software\n    ---------------\n      Odyssey received commands from Earth via radio and then\n      translated them into spacecraft actions. The flight software\n      had the capability to run many sequences concurrently in\n      addition to executing received commands immediately.\n \n      The data collection software was quite flexible.  The science\n      and engineering data were collected and then put in a variety\n      of holding bins called Application Identifiers (APIDs).  Ground\n      commands could easily modify the data routing and sampling\n      frequency.\n \n      A number of autonomous spacecraft performance functions were\n      part of the flight software.  The spacecraft ran routines\n      to control attitude and orientation without commands sent\n      from Earth.  The software also executed fault protection\n      routines to determine if any internal problem occurred.  If\n      a problem was found, a number of automatic preset actions\n      would occur to resolve the problem and put the spacecraft\n      into a standby mode until ground controllers provided\n      further direction.\n \n    Coordinate System\n    -----------------\n      The spacecraft frame is defined with the X axis parallel to\n      the stowed HGA boresight, the Y axis normal to the stowed\n      solar arrays, and the Z axis in the direction of the main\n      engine thrust (see figure below).  The origin of the frame\n      is centered on the launch vehicle separation plane.\n \n                                 _______________ HGA\n                                 \\             /\n              Science        ..   `._________.'\n               Orbit         || ._______________.\n             Velocity        || |       ^+Xsc   | Science Deck\n                ^.           || |       |       |\n                  `.         || |       |       |\n                    `.       || +Ysc    |       |\n                             ||@| <-----o +Zsc (out of page)\n                             || |               |\n                             || |               |\n                             || | Science Deck  |\n                      Solar  || ._______________.\n                      Array  ..\n \n                                   /\n                                  /\n                                 /\n                                V Nadir\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed\n    by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n    Technology for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space\n    Administration (NASA).\n \n    The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way\n    communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the\n    solar system.

Those data were then\n    relayed directly to stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN)\n    on Earth or indirectly using the Mars orbiters Mars Global Surveyor\n    (MGS) or 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY).  MER Radio Science observations\n    required that DSN and/or ODY hardware also participate in data\n    acquisition.  The following sections provide an overview first of\n    the MER spacecraft, then of the DSN ground system, and finally of\n    2001 Mars Odyssey as each supported MER science activities.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - Rover\n  ================================\n    The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission sent two identical\n    spacecraft to two different landing sites on Mars.  The hardware on\n    the first spacecraft is referred to as MER-2 (the rover named\n    Spirit which was sent to Gusev Crater), and the hardware on\n    the second spacecraft is referred to as MER-1 (the rover named\n    Opportunity sent to Meridiani Planum).  The spacecraft design owed a\n    lot of its heritage to the Mars Pathfinder configuration for cruise\n    and entry, descent, and landing.  For more detailed information on\n    the MER spacecraft, see [CRISPETAL2003].\n \n \n    Spacecraft Configuration for Entry, Descent, and Landing\n    --------------------------------------------------------\n      After separation from the cruise stage, the 840 kg entry vehicle\n      consisted of a backshell and heatshield enclosing the lander.  The\n      550 kg lander had a tetrahedral structure that the air bags were\n      deployed from and surrounded, and that housed the gas generators\n      for the airbags, the RADAR altimeter, motors for the unfolding of\n      the tetrahedron's four sides or 'petals,' and the rover lift\n      mechanism for standing up the rover.  On route to Mars, the rover\n      was stowed within the lander, and contained most of the power,\n      computing, and communication electronics for all phases of the\n      mission.  The backshell and heatshield provided thermal protection\n      from the hyperbolic entry into the Martian atmosphere through the\n      use of ablating materials.  Mounted inside the backshell was the\n      parachute, the deceleration and transverse impulse solid\n      rocket (TIRS) motors, a backshell inertial measurement unit, and\n      thermal batteries for the entry and descent phase.  The Entry,\n      Descent, and Landing camera was mounted on the lander radar\n      bracket.  The Descent Image Motion Estimation Subsystem (DIMES)\n      gathered the results of a real-time image correlation of surface\n      features contained in three successive Entry, Descent, and Landing\n      camera images of the Martian surface to compute the horizontal\n      velocity of the descending vehicle. TIRS used this horizontal\n      velocity measurement along with measurements of the attitude of\n      the backshell to compute a TIRS rocket firing solution.\n \n \n    Rover on the Surface of Mars\n    ----------------------------\n      After landing, the instrument host for each spacecraft is just the\n      rover itself, which is a 6-wheeled drive, 4-wheel-steered vehicle\n      180 kg in mass, including the science package.  At its wheel base,\n      the rover is approximately 141 cm long and 122 cm wide.  At the\n      height of the solar panel, the rover is approximately 225 cm wide\n      by 151 cm long.  In its deployed configuration with the Pancam\n      Mast Assembly (PMA) deployed, the rover is 154 cm tall.\n \n      The rocker bogie suspension system gave the rover the ability to\n      drive over obstacles approximately one wheel diameter (26 cm) in\n      size while providing a stable platform for instrument\n      measurements.  The distribution of mass of the vehicle allowed the\n      vehicle to be stable even at a 45 degree tilt.  Each wheel and\n      steering degree of freedom was independently actuated, which\n      allowed the vehicle to turn in place (turning diameter 1.9 m), to\n      skid steer to a tighter angle (turning diameter as small\n      as 0.9 m), to turn in gradual arcs, or to drag wheels that\n      effectively trench the Martian regolith.  When moving on flat\n      terrain, the vehicle could achieve a top speed of 5 cm/s.  Under\n      autonomous control using its hazard avoidance system, the rover\n      drove with an average speed of about 1 cm/sec.\n \n      The rover was powered by a combination of solar arrays and\n      rechargeable batteries.  The solar panel provides 30 strings of\n      triple junction cells (gallium indium phosphorus, gallium\n      arsenide, and germanium) covering 1.3 square meters, which\n      produced about 800 to 900 W hours per sol at the beginning of the\n      MER mission.  Each rover had two reference solar cells, one that\n      measures short circuit current and another that measures open\n      circuit voltage.  Due to the change in season from late southern\n      summer to early southern autumn, and the degradation in\n      performance due to dust deposition, the energy produced by this\n      array dropped to about 600 W h per sol, 90 sols after landing.\n      Energy was stored in two 8 A h lithium ion rechargeable batteries\n      to provide over 400 W h of energy to support rover peak power\n      operations and provide auxiliary heating and operations overnight.\n \n      Temperature-sensitive electronics were housed in the rover warm\n      electronics box (WEB) which is a box built with honeycomb\n      composite material and insulated with 2.5 cm of opacified aerogel.\n      A combination of radioisotope heater units, waste heat from\n      electronics, and auxiliary heating by survival heaters ensured\n      that the internal electronics were maintained between -40 and +50\n      degrees C as the external Mars environment cycle ranged from 0 to\n      -97 degrees C.  Survival heating in the WEB requires not more than\n      100 W h of energy during the coldest environment conditions.  The\n      rechargeable batteries housed in the WEB supplied this energy.\n \n      The rover received commands and transmitted data to the Earth\n      through two distinct systems: a direct-to-Earth X-band system\n      supported by both a low-gain antenna and a steerable high-gain\n      antenna (HGA), and a UHF system supported by a monopole antenna\n      which enables relay communication to orbiters at Mars.  Early in\n      the surface mission, the X-band system through the high-gain\n      antenna supported up to 28.8 kbps to a 70 m Deep Space Network\n      (DSN) station.  Commands were received through the high-gain\n      antenna at a rate of up to 2000 bps.  The X-band system through\n      the low-gain antenna provided a minimum capability of transmitting\n      telemetry at 40 bps and receiving commands at 40 bps throughout\n      the MER missions.  The UHF system supported telemetry rates of up\n      to 256 kbps during orbiter passes which lasted up to 8 minutes\n      each.  The UHF system also supported a command receipt capability\n      of 8 kbps through Odyssey only.\n \n      The computing, command, and data handling functions of the rover\n      were supported by a 20 MHz 32-bit RAD6000 processor housed in a\n      Versa Module Europa (VME) card cage.  This radiation hardened\n      processor had access to 128 Mbytes of DRAM and 256 Mbytes of\n      nonvolatile flash memory that supported a multiprocess C-coded\n      software architecture.  This system, supported by auxiliary\n      processing functions housed on boards within the VME card cage,\n      had the capability to acquire images from pairs of cameras, drive\n      up to 10 motors simultaneously from 35 motors located on the\n      vehicle, and process data from three spectrometers.  The\n      multiprocess architecture allowed communication, image\n      acquisition, and operation of payload elements to proceed\n      simultaneously.\n \n      During the surface mission, the rovers communicated on X-band\n      typically once a day, reporting on status and the results of the\n      execution of commands transmitted that day.  Data were also\n      relayed through the UHF communication system to the Mars Global\n      Surveyor and Mars Odyssey orbiters.  Useful over-flights by these\n      orbiters at the landing site occurred as frequently as twice\n      per day per orbiter.\n \n      Each rover carried the Athena Science Payload consisting of two\n      remote sensing instruments that viewed the terrain from the top of\n      a mast 154 cm above the ground, four devices for in-situ analysis\n      on the end of a robotic arm and several magnets and calibration\n      targets.  [SQUYRESETAL2003] describes this payload, the mast, the\n      robotic arm, and the plans for science investigation in more\n      detail.  Azimuth and elevation actuators permitted the collection\n      of data sets for specific targets, regions, or full 360-degree\n      panoramas from the mast instruments, which are the stereo\n      multispectral Panoramic Camera (Pancam) and Miniature Thermal\n      Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES).  The five degree-of-freedom\n      robotic arm positioned the following devices on rocks and soils\n      for in-situ analysis or rock abrasion: Alpha Particle X-ray\n      Spectrometer (APXS), Moessbauer Spectrometer (MB), Microscopic\n      Imager (MI), and Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT).\n \n      In addition, the stereo navigation cameras (Navcams) mounted on\n      the top of the mast and the stereo hazard detection cameras\n      (Hazcams) pointed towards the ground beneath the solar panels in\n      the front and rear of the rover were required for engineering\n      purposes (rover navigation, hazard avoidance, and safe movement\n      purposes and positioning of the robotic arm), but were also used\n      for science analysis [MAKIETAL2003].  [ARVIDSONETAL2003] provides\n      more detail on the use of rover engineering sensors for assessing\n      terrain and soil physical properties, dust accumulation, and\n      other related investigations.\n \n      The MER rover coordinate frame is defined as follows:\n \n      -- +Zr axis is normal to the rover top deck plane and points down,\n         from the top deck toward the wheels;\n \n      -- +Xr axis is parallel to the rover top deck plane and points\n         from the center of the top deck toward the PMA assembly;\n \n      -- +Yr completes the right hand frame.\n \n      The origin of the MER rover 'navigation' frame is directly above\n      the middle wheels, as shown in the diagram below.

Those data were then\n    relayed directly to stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN)\n    on Earth or indirectly using the Mars orbiters Mars Global Surveyor\n    (MGS) or 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY).  MER Radio Science observations\n    required that DSN and/or ODY hardware also participate in data\n    acquisition.  The following sections provide an overview first of\n    the MER spacecraft, then of the DSN ground system, and finally of\n    2001 Mars Odyssey as each supported MER science activities.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - Rover\n  ================================\n    The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission sent two identical\n    spacecraft to two different landing sites on Mars.  The hardware on\n    the first spacecraft is referred to as MER-2 (the rover named\n    Spirit which was sent to Gusev Crater), and the hardware on\n    the second spacecraft is referred to as MER-1 (the rover named\n    Opportunity sent to Meridiani Planum).  The spacecraft design owed a\n    lot of its heritage to the Mars Pathfinder configuration for cruise\n    and entry, descent, and landing.  For more detailed information on\n    the MER spacecraft, see [CRISPETAL2003].\n \n \n    Spacecraft Configuration for Entry, Descent, and Landing\n    --------------------------------------------------------\n      After separation from the cruise stage, the 840 kg entry vehicle\n      consisted of a backshell and heatshield enclosing the lander.  The\n      550 kg lander had a tetrahedral structure that the air bags were\n      deployed from and surrounded, and that housed the gas generators\n      for the airbags, the RADAR altimeter, motors for the unfolding of\n      the tetrahedron's four sides or 'petals,' and the rover lift\n      mechanism for standing up the rover.  On route to Mars, the rover\n      was stowed within the lander, and contained most of the power,\n      computing, and communication electronics for all phases of the\n      mission.  The backshell and heatshield provided thermal protection\n      from the hyperbolic entry into the Martian atmosphere through the\n      use of ablating materials.  Mounted inside the backshell was the\n      parachute, the deceleration and transverse impulse solid\n      rocket (TIRS) motors, a backshell inertial measurement unit, and\n      thermal batteries for the entry and descent phase.  The Entry,\n      Descent, and Landing camera was mounted on the lander radar\n      bracket.  The Descent Image Motion Estimation Subsystem (DIMES)\n      gathered the results of a real-time image correlation of surface\n      features contained in three successive Entry, Descent, and Landing\n      camera images of the Martian surface to compute the horizontal\n      velocity of the descending vehicle. TIRS used this horizontal\n      velocity measurement along with measurements of the attitude of\n      the backshell to compute a TIRS rocket firing solution.\n \n \n    Rover on the Surface of Mars\n    ----------------------------\n      After landing, the instrument host for each spacecraft is just the\n      rover itself, which is a 6-wheeled drive, 4-wheel-steered vehicle\n      180 kg in mass, including the science package.  At its wheel base,\n      the rover is approximately 141 cm long and 122 cm wide.  At the\n      height of the solar panel, the rover is approximately 225 cm wide\n      by 151 cm long.  In its deployed configuration with the Pancam\n      Mast Assembly (PMA) deployed, the rover is 154 cm tall.\n \n      The rocker bogie suspension system gave the rover the ability to\n      drive over obstacles approximately one wheel diameter (26 cm) in\n      size while providing a stable platform for instrument\n      measurements.  The distribution of mass of the vehicle allowed the\n      vehicle to be stable even at a 45 degree tilt.  Each wheel and\n      steering degree of freedom was independently actuated, which\n      allowed the vehicle to turn in place (turning diameter 1.9 m), to\n      skid steer to a tighter angle (turning diameter as small\n      as 0.9 m), to turn in gradual arcs, or to drag wheels that\n      effectively trench the Martian regolith.  When moving on flat\n      terrain, the vehicle could achieve a top speed of 5 cm/s.  Under\n      autonomous control using its hazard avoidance system, the rover\n      drove with an average speed of about 1 cm/sec.\n \n      The rover was powered by a combination of solar arrays and\n      rechargeable batteries.  The solar panel provides 30 strings of\n      triple junction cells (gallium indium phosphorus, gallium\n      arsenide, and germanium) covering 1.3 square meters, which\n      produced about 800 to 900 W hours per sol at the beginning of the\n      MER mission.  Each rover had two reference solar cells, one that\n      measures short circuit current and another that measures open\n      circuit voltage.  Due to the change in season from late southern\n      summer to early southern autumn, and the degradation in\n      performance due to dust deposition, the energy produced by this\n      array dropped to about 600 W h per sol, 90 sols after landing.\n      Energy was stored in two 8 A h lithium ion rechargeable batteries\n      to provide over 400 W h of energy to support rover peak power\n      operations and provide auxiliary heating and operations overnight.\n \n      Temperature-sensitive electronics were housed in the rover warm\n      electronics box (WEB) which is a box built with honeycomb\n      composite material and insulated with 2.5 cm of opacified aerogel.\n      A combination of radioisotope heater units, waste heat from\n      electronics, and auxiliary heating by survival heaters ensured\n      that the internal electronics were maintained between -40 and +50\n      degrees C as the external Mars environment cycle ranged from 0 to\n      -97 degrees C.

Its fueled\n    mass is 305 kg.  The spacecraft bus is a graphite-epoxy drum that is\n    1.37 m in diameter and 1.28 m tall.  Power is provided by solar\n    cells mounted on the surface of the bus assembly, which produce an\n    average of 186 w.  There is also a rechargeable, 4.8 amp-hr NiCd\n    battery for power during night side passes.  The science instruments\n    are mounted on three 2.5 m booms.  The Gamma Ray Spectrometer is\n    mounted on one boom, the Neutron Spectrometer and Alpha Particle\n    Spectrometers are mounted on another boom, and the Magnetometer and\n    Electron Reflectometer are mounted on the third boom.  The\n    Magnetometer instrument is mounted on a 1.2 m long boom extending\n    beyond the main boom to isolate it from the Electron Reflectometer.\n \n    The spacecraft bus houses three fuel tanks, six engines, and five\n    electronic units.  The fuel tanks at launch hold 138 kg of hydrazine\n    pressurized with helium.  There are two aft axial engines, two\n    forward axial engines, and two tangential engines.\n \n    The communication system consists of an S-band transponder, an omni\n    antenna with 3-pi steradian antenna pattern for uplink and downlink,\n    and a medium gain antenna for downlink.  The engineering-only\n    downlink data rate is 300 bps and the science/engineering downlink\n    data rate is 3600 bps.\n \n    Command and control of the spacecraft is achieved by a simple\n    Command and Data Handling (C&DH) unit.  As an individual command is\n    uplinked to the spacecraft, the C&DH directs the command to the\n    appropriate subsystem.  All science and engineering data are\n    collected by the C&DH and then are buffered and formatted for\n    downlink by the C&DH.  The data are downlinked at 1800 bps\n    immediately and simultaneously dumped into a solid state recorder.\n    The data stored on the solid state recorder is downlinked 53 minutes\n    later.  These delayed data frames are interleaved into the real-time\n    data stream, yielding a total downlink rate of 3600 bps.  The\n    purpose of the delayed stream is to receive data acquired during\n    communications blackout periods and to eliminate the need for a\n    commandable data recorder.\n \n    The LP spacecraft clock or frame counter increments once every 2\n    seconds.  It is stored in a 24-bit register.  This means that the\n    clock will reset after about 33.5 million seconds or about once per\n    year.  The clock reset on January 30, 1999 at about 12:09 UTC, which\n    was early in the Extended Mission.\n \n \n  Spacecraft Coordinate System\n  ============================\n    The Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) stage and spacecraft body\n    coordinate system is discussed below.  The origin of\n    coordinates is: a) in the separation plane between the\n    spacecraft and the adapter of the TLI stage; and b) at the\n    geometric center of the equilateral triangle defined by the\n    bolt holes for the separation nuts.\n \n    The Z axis is normal to the separation plane.  The +Z direction\n    is towards the medium gain antenna (forward) end of the\n    spacecraft.  The X axis is in the separation plane between the\n    spacecraft and the adapter of the TLI stage.  The -X direction\n    is parallel to the centerline of instrument boom No.  1 and\n    towards the Gamma Ray Spectrometer.  The Y axis is defined by\n    the right-hand rule.\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n    The Deep Space Network (DSN) is a telecommunications facility\n    managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute\n    of Technology for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space\n    Administration (NASA).\n \n    The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way communications\n    between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar system.  To\n    carry out this function it is equipped with high-power transmitters,\n    low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and\n    control systems.\n \n    The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately\n    equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone\n    (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and\n    Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the complexes are\n    located in the northern hemisphere while the third is in the\n    southern hemisphere.\n \n    Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their diameters,\n    construction, or operational characteristics: 70-m diameter,\n    standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter (HEF), and\n    34-m beam waveguide (BWG).  These DSN complexes, in conjunction with\n    telecommunications subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft,\n    constitute the major elements of instrumentation for radio science\n    investigations.\n \n    For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].\n \n \n  Science Packages\n  ================\n    The Lunar Prospector spacecraft has five science instruments.  The\n    instruments are a Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), a Neutron\n    Spectrometer (NS), an Alpha Particle Spectrometer (APS), a\n    Magnetometer (MAG), and an Electron Reflectometer (ER).  A Doppler\n    Gravity Experiment (DGE) uses Doppler tracking data for deriving\n    gravity measurements.  In addition, the spacecraft spin rate and\n    attitude are determined on the ground from data derived from a sun\n    sensor and an IR Earth/Moon limb crossing sensor.","image_url":"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/system/content_pages/main_images/1282_78777main_befcras.jpg","tools":[]},{"tags":["Orbiter"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.lcross","display_name":"Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS)","display_description":"Instrument Host Overview\n    =========================\n \n    The LCROSS (Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite)\n    mission was conceived as a low-cost means of determining the\n    nature of hydrogen detected at the polar regions of the moon.\n \n    LCROSS was selected as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)\n    secondary payload on April 10th, 2006 and launched with LRO on\n    June 18th, 2009.  To meet the requirements of a secondary\n    payload, the LCROSS Shepherding Spacecraft (SSC) was built\n    around an EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) ring, originally\n    designed as a mating interface for up to six small spacecraft or\n    experiments as secondary payloads on Delta IV and Atlas V\n    launches.  Developed by Northrop Grumman, the SSC featured five\n    equipment panels and a solar array mounted radially at the ESPA\n    mate ports.  A single monopropellant tank was mounted within the\n    ESPA ring.  For launch, the nearly 900 kg (wet mass) LCROSS\n    SSC was mated between the Centaur upper stage and LRO.\n \n    The SSC utilized copies of several LRO avionics units, including\n    its RAD750-based single-board computer, power and thruster\n    control electronics, S-band communications electronics, and\n    SpaceWire bus electronics.  LCROSS flight software derived\n    heavily from software on previous programs, including EO-1 and\n    WMAP.  LCROSS communicated in S-band via two omnidirectional\n    antennas and two medium-gain antennas.  Transponder electronics\n    enabled downlink at data rates up to 1 Mbps and uplink at 16\n    kbps.  Following launch and LRO separation, attitude control was\n    passed from the Centaur to the SSC.  The attitude control system\n    (ACS) provided three-axis control using an inertial reference\n    unit (IRU; no accelerometers), a star tracker, coarse sun\n    sensors for emergency automated sun-relative attitude capture\n    and tracking, and a set of eight monopropellant 5 N thrusters.\n    Two additional 22 N thrusters provided orbit maneuvering\n    capability.  The ACS featured twelve control mode/submode\n    combinations, six tailored for specific operations while\n    attached to the Centaur, and a second set for use after Centaur\n    separation.  The LCROSS propellant tank contained just over 305\n    kg of hydrazine for both attitude control and orbit maneuvering.\n    The LCROSS power system featured a 368 W solar array and four 20\n    A-h batteries.  LCROSS performed thermal control using a\n    combination of resistive heaters, passive radiators, and\n    multi-layer insulation.\n \n    The LCROSS Payload\n \n    The LCROSS Payload consists of nine science instruments, their\n    supporting electrical, mechanical and optical harnesses, a\n    central data handling unit (DHU) assembly, and thermal hardware\n    (heaters, thermistors, and thermostats), all assembled onto the\n    LCROSS spacecraft R6 Radiator Panel.  Eight of the nine science\n    instruments are configured with their apertures in the +X\n    direction (spacecraft body frame/SBF) and are accommodated in\n    the Payload Observation Deck (POD).  The ninth instrument, near\n    infrared spectrometer #2 (NSP2), has its entrance optical\n    element orientated in the -Z direction (spacecraft body\n    frame/SBF).  The Payload is located on the inboard side of the\n    LCROSS spacecraft R6 Panel.\n \n    Visible Camera\n \n    The LCROSS visible camera (VIS) is a ruggedized analog video\n    camera from the RocketCamTM camera family developed by Ecliptic\n    Enterprises, Inc.  The unit consists of a camera module and a\n    lens.  The camera's focal plane CCD sensor is 752 [H] x 582 [V]\n    pixel format, operating at 30 Hz (60 fields/sec).  The flight\n    unit's lens is a 12 mm (focal length), f/1.2 lens providing a\n    30.1 degree [H] x 22.8 degree [V] (37.8 degree [Diagonal]) field-of-view.\n    Interlaced NTSC fields are sampled by the Data Handling Unit\n    (DHU) at 720 x 243 resolution resulting in a final image\n    resolution of 720 x 486 pixels.  Each pixel is 24-bit RGB with 8\n    bits per color channel.  These images are compressed using a\n    lossy compression algorithm performed by the Analog Devices 611\n    Video Codec set on 80% quality and decompressed on the ground.\n    The LCROSS visible camera contains no cryogenic liquids or\n    moving parts.  The visible camera's peak power during operation\n    is 2.9 W.  The visible camera has been fixed to an\n    auto-gain/white balance setting.\n \n    Near-Infrared Cameras\n \n    The LCROSS payload contains two near infrared (IR) (0.9-1.7 um)\n    cameras (NIR1/NIR2).  Each camera consists of a Goodrich Sensors\n    Unlimited model SU320-KTX and a CCTV lens. Each camera's focal\n    plane InGaAs sensor has a 320 [H] x 240 [V] pixel format.  The\n    25 mm, f/1.4 C-mount glass lens provides a 28.7 degree [H] x 21.7\n    degree [V] (36.0 degree [Diagonal]) field-of-view.  Although the\n    camera's native format provides 320 [H] x 240 [V] 12-bit images,\n    the images are converted within the camera to an analog NTSC\n    signal before transfer to the DHU where they are captured at 720\n    [H] x 486 [V].  Due to similar processing within the DHU as\n    needed for the VIS images, the two NIR camera images are\n    captured as 24-bit per pixel RGB.  Because the NIR cameras\n    provide grayscale images, the three RGB channels are identical\n    except for noise introduced in the conversion to and from\n    NTSC. These images are compressed in the DHU using a lossy\n    compression algorithm performed by the Analog Devices 611 Video\n    Codec set on 80% quality and decompressed on the ground.  In\n    addition to a camera body and a lens, near infrared camera #1\n    (NIR1) also contains a long-pass filter (wavelength > 1.4 um).\n    NIR2, in comparison, is filter-less.\n \n    Lenses for both cameras were provided by UkaOptics\n    (http://www.ukaoptics.com/ #2514M) as part of the standard\n    Goodrich package. These lenses are not optimized for the IR.\n    The IR throughput of the lenses has not been documented, but is\n    expected to be ~40%.  The near-infrared cameras contain no\n    cryogenic liquids or moving parts.  There is an internal\n    thermo-electric cooler that actively cools the InGaAs sensor.\n    The manufacturer default settings for this cooler are used.\n    Each camera's peak power during operation is 1.6 W.  Both gain\n    and exposure times are configurable by commands sent to the\n    camera.\n \n    Mid-Infrared Cameras\n \n    The LCROSS payload contains two mid-infrared (MIR) (6.0-13.5 um)\n    cameras (MIR1/MIR2).  Mid-infrared camera #1 (MIR1) is a\n    ruggedized vanadium oxide (VOx) microbolometer MIRIC TB2-30,\n    from Thermoteknix Ltd.  Mid-infrared camera #2 (MIR2) is model\n    ThermoVision Micron from Flir Systems/Indigo Operations.  Each\n    camera's uncooled microbolometer focal plane sensor has a 164\n    [H] x 128 [V] pixel format and is digitized at 14-bit\n    resolution.  Each camera has a 30 mm, f/1.6 lens providing a\n    15.0 degree [H] x 11.0 degree [V] (18.6 degree [Diagonal]) field-of-view.\n    MIR1 also contains a 6-10 Om bandpass filter.  MIR2 is\n    filter-less.  MIR1 is backfilled with dry Argon gas to prevent\n    degradation due to humidity for terrestrial applications and\n    does not contain any component volatile in vacuum.  Internal to\n    both MIR modules is an instrumented-motorized shutter to provide\n    a reference for temperature measurements.  Each camera's peak\n    power during operation is 1.3 W.  A camera gain, which\n    determines the sensitivity to temperature scenes (high gain: -20\n    degC < T < +150 degC, low gain: +150 degC < T < +500 degC), is\n    configurable with a command sent to the camera.\n \n    Total Luminance Photometer\n \n    The Total Luminance Photometer (TLP) provides visible light\n    (400-1000 nm) intensity data at a 1000 Hz sampling rate.  The\n    TLP instrument consists of two elements: (1) the Sensor\n    Electronics Module (SEM), which contains the optics and sensor\n    assembly and signal filtering, and (2) the Digital Electronics\n    Module (DEM), which converts the analog sensor signal to a\n    digital output, as well as higher order functionality.  The DEM\n    is a commercial package that was modified for LCROSS.  This\n    instrument is designed and manufactured by NASA Ames Research\n    Center.  The optics in the SEM delivers an unobstructed ~10\n    degree diameter field-of-view.  The TLP's sensor element is an\n    uncooled Advanced Photonix, Inc.  (API) avalanche photo diode\n    (APD) packaged in a dryair sensor container that can operate in\n    a vacuum.  The TLP SEM is connected by an electrical harness to\n    the TLP DEM.  The SEM and DEM are located within the Payload\n    Observation Deck (POD) and on the R6 Panel, respectively.  The\n    DEM is interfaced with the DHU (also on the R6 Panel) via a\n    second cable, from which it is controlled.  The SEM and DEM's\n    peak power during operation are 2.5 W and 12.0 W, respectively.\n \n    Visible Spectrometer\n \n    The LCROSS visible spectrometer (VSP) is a modified-commercial\n    model from Ocean Optics Ltd., with its core operation based on\n    their COTS QE65000 model.  It has been adapted for space use and\n    is of similar design to a recently delivered spectrometer to Los\n    Alamos for a Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) payload for launch in\n    2011.  The VSP spectrometer design consists of an FC optical\n    fiber input (0.11 NA) feeding a 25 micron x 1 mm entrance slit,\n    where light is diffracted by a 1-inch f/4 optical cross\n    Czerny-Turner spectrometer (grating 600 lines/mm, blazed at 350\n    nm) with an oversized camera mirror.  The ~263-650 nm spectrum\n    from the slit is imaged onto a 1044 x 64 pixel Hamamatsu CCD\n    detector.  The data is co-added within the spectrometer,\n    delivering a 16- bit, 1 x 1044 pixel spectra to the DHU\n    electronics for packaging.  The first 1024 pixels contain\n    spectral data.  The remaining 20 pixels contain provide\n    temporally coincident but off-slit dark reference pixels.  The\n    VSP resolving power is R~300, 500, and 850 at 300, 400 and 600\n    nm, respectively.  The VSP contains no moving parts.  The CCD\n    detector is cooled by an internal Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC),\n    whose set point is programmable.  The VSP power is 4.8 W (TEC\n    off), and can reach 11.8 W (at TEC setting -10 degC at operating\n    temperature +19-20 degC).  Integration time (between 8 ms and 65.5\n    s) is configurable.  Additionally, the VSP supports two\n    operation modes - single and bracket spectra.  The former is a\n    single spectra acquisition of the appropriate requested\n    integration time.  The latter is a three-spectra acquisition\n    defined by a base integration time and a multiplier that is\n    divided or multiplied by the base integration time to yield a\n    shorter or longer exposure time, respectively.  The VSP is fed\n    by a 75 cm length 600-micron core-diameter UV/Vis glass fiber\n    attached to a fore-optics unit in the POD.  This fore-optics\n    unit (see below) is a fixed two-mirror and one lens system\n    designed to provide a one degree diameter field-of-view.\n \n    Near-Infrared Spectrometers\n \n    The LCROSS payload contains two near-infrared spectrometers\n    (NSP1/NSP2), located on the R6 Panel.  Their electronics units\n    are identical, but they have different fore-optics designs.\n    Near infrared spectrometer #1, NSP1, also known as the nadir\n    NSP, is located inside the POD and its aperture is positioned in\n    the +X direction (spacecraft body frame/SBF).  Near infrared\n    spectrometer #2, NSP2, also known as the solar-viewer or\n    occultation NSP, has its wide-field aperture centered along the\n    -Z direction (spacecraft body frame/SBF).  Both spectrometers\n    provide 1.20-2.45 um spectral coverage and nominal resolution\n    0.035 um/pixel, yielding resolving powers R ~ 37-65 (NSP1) and R\n    ~ 36-77 (NSP2).  Both spectrometers are manufactured by\n    Polychromix, a company whose primary spectrometer line is\n    designed for material analysis and chemical sensing.  The\n    spectrometers are designed to take a single SMA NA=0.22 fiber as\n    input instead of a slit, whose diameter defines the instrument\n    resolution.  Since each spectrometer contains a single\n    TEC-cooled InGaAs sensor element, a 1D-spectrum is created using\n    an innovative electronically-tunable MEMS device that spatially\n    masks the dispersed spectrum within the instrument.  This series\n    of masks undergoes a digital transform on the ground to recreate\n    the spectral information.  The spectrometer contains no moving\n    parts (excluding the MEMS chip) and the peak power for each NSP\n    is 2.5 W.  NSP1 and NSP2 are each fed by a single 600-micron\n    core-diameter low-OH glass fiber of length 75 cm and 1.45 m,\n    respectively, attached to a fore-optic.  The NSP1 fore-optics\n    unit (see below) is located within the POD and is a fixed\n    two-mirror and one lens system designed to provide 1 degree\n    diameter field-of-view.  The NSP2 fore-optic (see below) is a\n    diffuser providing ~130 degree fieldof- view, and is located external\n    to the POD housing.  Both spectrometers have three modes, Impact\n    Flash (IF), Hadamard Spectrum (HS) and Diagnostic Mode (DM),\n    which are configurable by sending a command to the units.\n \n    Fore-Optics and Fibers\n \n    The LCROSS payload contains two fore-optic units and three\n    fibers.  The three single-core fibers connect the electrical\n    units of the three LCROSS spectrometers to their respective\n    fore-optics (i.e., light-gathering optics).  All fibers are\n    manufactured by Fiberguide Industries.  The two fore-optics, a\n    dual-scope fore-optic feeding the NSP1 and VSP spectrometers and\n    a diffuser fore-optic feeding the NSP2 spectrometer, have been\n    designed specifically for the LCROSS mission by Aurora\n    Technologies.  The dualscope fore-optic provides 1 degree\n    diameter field-of-view (per scope) and a separation between the\n    two scopes of < 0.1 degrees.  The diffuser fore-optic provides\n    an unattenuated ~130 degree field-of-view.  The fibers were chosen to\n    optimize for the band-pass and be compatible with the throughput\n    and entrance optic requirements by the spectrometers.  For the\n    VSP, the fiber is a 75 cm SuperguideG UV/VIS Spectral Range with\n    NA=0.12+/-0.02.  For the NSPs, the fibers are AnhydroguideG Low\n    OH fibers with NA=0.22+/-0.02, with lengths 75 cm and 145 cm for\n    NSP1 and NSP2, respectively.  All three fibers have 600 Om\n    core-diameters and are encased in a 1/8 inch (ID) stainless\n    steel monocoil for ruggedization.\n \n    Data Handling Unit\n \n    The LCROSS Data Handling Unit (DHU) is a ruggedized video camera\n    controller and data handling system based on the ruggedized\n    Digital Video Systems (DVS) developed by Ecliptic Enterprises,\n    Inc.  It captures and transmits compressed digital spectrometer,\n    video and photometric data telemetry (in CCSDS format) from all\n    nine instruments from the LCROSS science payload.  The DHU is a\n    single conduction-cooled chassis designed to operate as\n    independently as possible from its host vehicle.  In the\n    limiting case, DHU operation is completely self-contained except\n    for activation/deactivation commands that originate from the\n    ground.  The DHU can store up to 10 slots of Non- Volatile\n    Memory (NVM), which can be used for sequencing power and\n    operational commands to the science instruments.  The DHU\n    contains no moving parts, operates from the 32 V power supply by\n    the spacecraft power bus, and its peak power during operation is\n    13.5 W.  The DHU also provides the time-stamping function of all\n    the science instruments and itself and provides error logs for\n    when science data frames are dropped or corrupted due to\n    bandwidth or performance issues.","image_url":"https://www.nasa.gov/images/content/226580main_2007-08-02%20On%20Way%20In.jpg","tools":[3,4]},{"tags":["Orbiter"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.grail-a","display_name":"Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory A (GRAIL Ebb)","display_description":"Instrument Host Overview\n  =========================\n \n  For typical Radio Science experiments on other missions, the link\n  from the spacecraft to the DSN stations contains the primary science\n  content of the experiment, which makes the DSN a part of the\n  extended Radio Science instrument.

A single-string\n    architecture met this short mission's reliability requirements.\n    The resulting design met all GRAIL mission and science\n    requirements with ample technical margins, providing flexibility\n    to solve problems that might arise during development and which\n    met or exceeded design principles established by the Jet\n    Propulsion Laboratory.\n \n    Each of the two GRAIL spacecraft, GRAIL-A and GRAIL-B, was about\n    the size of a washing machine and had about 200 kg of mass. They\n    were nearly identical; but the need to point antennas at one\n    another required differences in the MoonKAM mounting and in the\n    angles of the star trackers used for attitude control and the\n    antennas through which the orbiters measured the changing\n    distance between them. These factors also required that GRAIL-B\n    precede GRAIL-A in lunar orbit.\n \n    Each spacecraft bus was a rectangular composite structure. The\n    science payload ranging antennas were in thermal enclosures and\n    were mounted so that they were nominally on the line between the\n    centers of mass of the two spacecraft. The other components of the\n    payload instrument were on a single interior bus panel for easy\n    integration and testing.\n \n    Two non-articulated solar arrays of XSS-11 heritage were deployed\n    just after separation from the launch vehicle. Warm gas systems,\n    identical to those on XSS-11, provided delta-V for maneuvers and\n    unloading of the 3 reaction wheels.

The S-band\n    telecommunications sub-system for communication with the DSN used\n    components with heritage from Themis and Genesis.\n \n    The spacecraft was built and the science payload was integrated\n    and tested at Lockheed Martin's Denver facility. LM used two\n    system-level spacecraft test labs (STL) and one software simulator\n    (SoftSim) testbed with unlimited copies that enabled integration\n    and verification of all hardware and software throughout the\n    Assembly Test and Launch Operations (ATLO) cycle.\n \n    See [HOFFMAN2009] for more information about the spacecraft.\n \n    Spacecraft Configurations\n    -------------------------\n    During its mission, GRAIL needed to operate in four distinct\n    mission configurations.\n \n    Launch: During launch, the two spacecraft had to be fitted together\n    within the nose cone, or payload fairing, of the launch vehicle.\n    Large parts, such as the solar arrays, were designed to be folded\n    up.\n \n    Cruise: As soon as the two spacecraft were clear of the launch\n    vehicle, the body-fixed solar arrays were deployed to begin\n    producing power. The high-gain antenna also became operational.\n \n    Lunar Orbit Insertion: The lunar orbit insertion required numerous\n    maneuvers to circularize the two orbits. No science observations\n    took place, as the spacecraft were not in formation flying yet.\n \n    Science Operations: During the Science Phase, the two spacecraft\n    were placed in a precision formation flying configuration in order\n    to point to each other and exchange two radio links at Ka- and\n    S-bands.\n \n    Coordinate Systems\n    ------------------\n \n    Two coordinate systems are used to reference the various GRAIL\n    instruments. The definitions are summarized below.\n \n    1) Mechanical Frame (MF): This is defined by the spacecraft\n    manufacturer. It is the reference frame for such things as KBR\n    horn location, center of mass, and thruster locations.\n \n    +X = Parallel to, and in opposite direction from, the solar array\n    normal vector\n    +Z = Normal to star tracker bus plate\n    +Y = +Z ? +X\n \n    An onboard attitude control sub-system approximately orients the\n    mechanical frame with -Z along the line of flight and -/+ Y\n    pointed towards the moon.\n \n    2) Science Reference Frame (SRF): This is the Mechanical Frame as\n    realized by the Star Tracker. If the Star Tracker were perfectly\n    aligned, MF would equal SRF. SRF is the reference frame for GRAIL\n    science measurements.\n \n    Major Spacecraft Components\n    ---------------------------\n    Science Payload Instruments:\n \n    There are two payload elements on each GRAIL orbiter: the Lunar\n    Gravity Ranging System (LGRS) which is the science instrument, and\n    the MoonKAM lunar-imager which is used for Education and Public\n    Outreach. The LGRS is based on the instrument used for the Gravity\n    Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, which has been\n    mapping Earth's gravity since 2002. The LGRS is responsible for\n    sending and receiving the signals needed to accurately and\n    precisely measure the changes in range between the two orbiters.\n    The LGRS consists of an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO), Microwave\n    Assembly (MWA), a Time-Transfer Assembly (TTA), and the Gravity\n    Recovery Processor Assembly (GPA).\n \n    The USO provides a steady reference signal that is used by all of\n    the instrument subsystems. Within the LGRS, the USO provides the\n    reference frequency for the MWA and the TTA. The MWA converts the\n    USO reference signal to the Ka-band frequency, which is\n    transmitted to the other orbiter.\n \n    The function of the TTA is to provide a two-way time-transfer link\n    between the spacecraft to both synchronize and measure the clock\n    offset between the two LGRS clocks. The TTA generates an S-band\n    signal from the USO reference frequency and sends a GPS-like\n    ranging code to the other spacecraft. The GPA combines all the\n    inputs received from the MWA and TTA to produce the radiometric\n    data that are downlinked to the ground. In addition to acquiring\n    the inter-spacecraft measurements, the LGRS also provides a\n    one-way signal to the ground based on the USO, which is\n    transmitted via the X-band Radio Science Beacon (RSB). The\n    steady-state drift of the USO is measured via the one-way Doppler\n    data provided by the RSB.\n \n    The LGRS instrument is summarized below.\n \n         2 X-band beacon antennas for Doppler ranging measurements\n           when the spacecraft was visible from Earth. The X-band\n           signal was carrier-only and not\n         1 S-band time-transfer system antenna, which sent a\n           time-synchronization code back and forth between the\n           spacecraft\n         1 Ka-band ranging antenna for precision distance measurement\n           between the spacecraft\n \n    For more information on the GRAIL radio systems, see\n    [KLIPSTEINETAL2009].\n \n    Structures:\n \n    The solar panels and antennas were body fixed, so there were no\n    moving parts in the spacecraft structure that would affect science\n    observations.\n \n    Telecommunications Sub-System:\n \n    The telecom sub-system included the following on each spacecraft:\n \n         2 S-band transponder antennas to communicate with Earth\n \n    Each of the pairs of S-band transponder antennas had one antenna\n    mounted on the sunny side of the spacecraft and one mounted on the\n    dark side. The sunny-side antennas pointed to Earth during the\n    full moon and the dark-side antennas pointed to Earth during new\n    moon. This design obviated the need to mechanically rotate the\n    antennas during the mission, which would have moved the\n    spacecraft's center of mass with respect to the Ka-Band ranging\n    and X-Band beacon paths, disturbing the science measurements.\n \n    Propulsion Sub-System:\n \n    The propulsion sub-system on each spacecraft included:\n \n    A propellant tank, which could hold up to 103.5 kilograms of the\n    monopropellant hydrazine.\n \n    A hydrazine catalytic thruster for lunar-orbit insertion and\n    trajectory changes, and a warm-gas system with 8 thruster valves\n    for attitude control and other small maneuvers.\n \n    Command and Data-Handling Sub-System:\n \n    The C&DH sub-system controlled all spacecraft functions. This\n    system:\n \n         * managed all forms of data on the spacecraft;\n         * executed commands (including maneuver commands) sent from\n           Earth;\n         * prepared data for transmission to Earth;\n         * managed collection of solar power and charging of the\n           batteries;\n         * collected and processed information about all sub-systems\n           and payloads;\n         * kept and distributed the spacecraft time;\n         * calculated spacecraft position in orbit around the Moon;\n         * autonomously monitored and responded to any onboard\n           problems that occurred.\n \n    The key parts of this system were:\n \n         Space Flight Computer\n         Flight Software\n         Solid State Recorder\n \n    Attitude Control Sub-system:\n \n    The Attiude Control Sub-system (ACS) controlled the orientation of\n    the orbiter as it traveled through space and maintained knowledge\n    of where celestial bodies were located -- for example, Earth and\n    the Sun. This knowledge was critical for the spacecraft to perform\n    the correct maneuvers to get to the Moon, to keep its solar arrays\n    pointed toward the Sun for battery charging, and to keep its\n    S-Band antenna pointed toward the Earth in order to maintain\n    communications.\n \n    Once in orbit around the Moon, the ACS also maintained constant\n    knowledge of where the spacecraft was in its orbit.\n \n    The Attitude Control sub-system provided three-axis stabilized\n    control and consisted of a sun sensor, a star tracker, reaction\n    wheels, and an inertial measurement unit.\n \n    Electrical Power:\n \n    The electrical power sub-system was responsible for generating,\n    storing, and distributing power to the orbiter systems. The\n    electrical power system included two solar arrays and a lithium\n    ion battery. Each solar array was capable of producing 700 watts\n    at the end of the mission. The arrays were deployed shortly after\n    separation from the launch vehicle and remained fixed throughout\n    the mission. Each battery had a capacity of 30 amp-hours and was\n    used to provide power when the spacecraft was in the Moon's\n    shadow.\n \n    Solar panels: The only source of replenishable power is sunlight.\n    Solar panels are mounted one side of each orbiter and capable in a\n    body-fixed position.\n \n    Thermal Sub-Systems:\n \n    The thermal sub-system maintained the right temperatures in all\n    parts of the spacecraft. It employed several conduction- and\n    radiation-based techniques for thermal control.  Its components\n    included:\n \n         Radiators\n         Surface coatings\n         Thermal blankets\n         Heaters\n \n \n  Instrument Host Overview - DSN\n  ==============================\n \n  Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation with elements\n  both on the spacecraft and at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).\n  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine\n  telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.\n \n  The Deep Space Network was a telecommunications facility managed by\n  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of\n  Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space\n  Administration.\n \n  The primary function of the DSN was to provide two-way\n  communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar\n  system.  To carry out this function the DSN was equipped with\n  high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and\n  appropriate monitoring and control systems.\n \n  The DSN consisted of three complexes situated at approximately\n  equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone\n  (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and\n  Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).

Three remote sensing science investigations\n      resided on the two-axis scan platform: a pair of high\n      resolution slow scan televison framing cameras (the Visual\n      Imaging Subsystem, or VIS); a near-infrared spectrometer for\n      atmospheric water detection (the Mars Atmosphere Water\n      Detector, MAWD); and a visual and thermal infrared radiometer\n      system (Infrared Thermal Mapper, IRTM).\n \n      The landers each carried two facsimile cameras providing stereo\n      views of the surface; a boom-mounted set of meteorology\n      instruments; an X-ray fluorescence experiment for inorganic\n      chemical analysis of soil; a gas chromatograph mass\n      spectrometer to measure the soil and atmosphere; three biology\n      experiments: the pyrolytic release, labeled release, and gas\n      exchange systems; a seismometer; a magnetic properties\n      experiment.  Soil physical properties experiments were carried\n      out using several of the abovementioned systems.

The\n    spacecraft is roughly 2.5 meters across and its mass is 465 kg\n    including propellant. Design features include 64 Gbits of redundant\n    solid-state data storage, a 290 m/s propulsion budget, and the\n    capability to transmit data from 32 AU at almost 1 kilobit/second.\n \n    The instrument payload [Stern & Cheng, 2002, STERN&CHENG2002]\n    comprises the two-sensor RALPH Vis-IR remote sensing package, the\n    ALICE UV imaging spectrometer, the REX radio/radiometry experiment,\n    the two-sensor PEPSSI/SWAP plasma suite, the LORRI long-focal-length\n    imager, and the SDC student-built dust counter.\n \n \n  Payload\n  =======\n    The New Horizons team selected instruments that not only directly\n    measure NASA-specified items of interest (NASA AO 01-OSS-01, 2001,\n    [NASAAO2001]), but also provide backup to other instruments on the\n    spacecraft should one fail during the mission.\n \n    The payload comprises seven instruments:\n \n \n    RALPH\n    -----\n      The main objectives for the RALPH instrument are to obtain high\n      resolution color maps and surface composition maps of the surfaces\n      of Pluto and Charon. The instrument has two separate channels: the\n      Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) and the Linear Etalon\n      Imaging Spectral Array (LEISA). A single telescope with a 3-inch\n      (6-centimeter) aperture collects and focuses the light used in both\n      channels.\n \n      RALPH/MVIC operates at visible wavelengths and has 4 different\n      filters for producing color maps. One filter allows measurement of\n      the methane frost distribution over the surface, while the others\n      are more generic and cover blue, red and near-infrared colors,\n      respectively. MVIC also has two panchromatic filters that pass\n      essentially all visible light.  This will be useful for low-light\n      level observations requiring maximum sensitivity.  In all cases,\n      the light passes from the telescope through the filters and is\n      focused onto a charge coupled device (CCD).\n \n      RALPH/LEISA operates at infrared wavelengths, and its etalon (a filter\n      with a narrow spectral bandpass that varies linearly in one dimension)\n      is bonded to the illuminated side of the IR detector.  As a result,\n      each row of detector pixels receives only light of a particular\n      wavelength.  Spectral maps are produced by sweeping the FOV of the\n      instrument across a scene, sequentially sampling each point in the\n      scene at each wavelength.  LEISA maps the distribution of frosts of\n      methane (CH4), molecular nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), and\n      water (H2O) over the surface of Pluto and the water frost\n      distribution over the surface of Charon.  LEISA data may also reveal\n      new constituents on the surfaces that have never before been detected.\n \n    ALICE\n    -----\n      Alice is an ultraviolet imaging spectrometer that probes the\n      atmospheric composition of Pluto.\n \n      Alice has two modes of operation: an airglow mode, which measures\n      emissions from atmospheric constituents, and an occultation mode,\n      which views either the Sun or a bright star through the atmosphere\n      producing absorption by the atmospheric constituents. The Alice\n      occultation mode occurs just after New Horizons passes behind Pluto\n      and looks back at the Sun through the Pluto atmosphere.\n \n \n    REX\n    ---\n      REX is an acronym for Radio EXperiment. It is integrated into the\n      New Horizons radio telecommunications system.\n \n      Using an occultation technique similar to that described above for\n      the Alice instrument, REX probes the Pluto atmosphere. After New\n      Horizons flies by Pluto, its 2.1 meter radio antenna points back at\n      Earth. On Earth, powerful radio transmitters in the NASA Deep Space\n      Network (DSN) point at New Horizons and send radio signals to the\n      spacecraft.  As the spacecraft passes behind Pluto, the atmosphere\n      bends the radio waves by an amount that depends on the average\n      molecular weight of the gas in the atmosphere, the atmospheric\n      temperature, and the closest approach distance of the raypath at\n      each instant of time. REX samples the received radio signal and\n      sends the data back to Earth for analysis\n \n      REX also has a radiometry mode, which measures the weak radio\n      thermal emission from Pluto itself. When REX looks back at Pluto\n      following the flyby, radiometry data are taken to derive a value for\n      the Pluto nightside temperature.\n \n \n    LORRI\n    -----\n      The instrument that provides the highest spatial resolution on New\n      Horizons is LORRI - short for LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager -\n      which comprises a telescope with a 20.8cm aperture that focuses\n      visible light onto a charge coupled device (CCD). LORRI has a very\n      simple design; there are no filters or moving parts. Near the time\n      of closest approach, LORRI takes images of the Pluto surface at 100m\n      resolution.\n \n \n    SWAP\n    ----\n      The Solar Wind Analyzer around Pluto (SWAP) instrument measures\n      charged particles from the solar wind near Pluto to determine\n      whether Pluto has a magnetosphere and how fast the atmosphere is\n      escaping.\n \n \n    PEPSSI\n    ------\n      Another plasma-sensing instrument, the Pluto Energetic Particle\n      Spectrometer Science Investigation (PEPSSI), searches for neutral\n      atoms that escape the Pluto atmosphere and subsequently become\n      charged by their interaction with the solar wind.\n \n    SDC\n    ---\n      The Student Dust Counter, which was later re-named The Venetia\n      Burney Student Dust Counter (SDC), is an Education and Public\n      Outreach project.  SDC measures the dust density of the\n      Interplanetary Dust Particles (IDP) by measuring the charge\n      generated in the SDC sensor from dust impact events.  From this may\n      be inferred the size and distribution of dust particles along the\n      entire New Horizons trajectory, including regions of interplanetary\n      space never before sampled.  Such dust particles are created by\n      comets shedding material and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) colliding\n      with other KBOs.  The SDC is managed and was built primarily by\n      students at the University of Colorado in Boulder, with supervision\n      from professional space scientists.\n \n \n  Spacecraft reference frame (a.k.a. Coordinate system)\n  =====================================================\n    During hibernation and other periods of inactivity, the spacecraft is\n    designed to spin about its +Y axis, which is also the nominal\n    boresight of the High Gain Antenna (HGA) and REX.  Imaging instruments\n    have nominal boresights pointing along the -X spacecraft axis.  The\n    RTG (see Power below) is a cylinder extending out along the +X\n    spacecraft axis to keep it away from the instruments.  The +Z axis\n    completes a right-handed three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate\n    system.  Note that each instrument has its own reference frame.\n \n    The following two sketches, extracted from the SPICE Frames kernel,\n    represent the spacecraft as viewed from the spacecraft +X and +Y\n    directions.

The New Horizons mission operations team\n    communicates with the spacecraft through the Deep Space Network (DSN).\n    The DSN comprises facilities in the Mojave Desert in California; near\n    Madrid, Spain; and near Canberra, Australia.\n \n \n  Power\n  =====\n    Electrical power for the New Horizons spacecraft and science\n    instruments is provided by a single radioisotope thermoelectric\n    generator, or RTG, supplied by the Department of Energy.  The New\n    Horizons trajectory takes it more than 4 billion miles from Earth,\n    where light from the Sun is 1,000 times fainter than at Earth.  An RTG\n    is used on missions, such as New Horizons, that can not use solar\n    power - yet require a proven, reliable power supply that can produce\n    up to several kilowatts of power and operate under severe\n    environmental conditions for many years.\n \n    Carrying out the New Horizons mission safely is a top priority at\n    NASA. As part of that focus, NASA informed the public about use by New\n    Horizons of an RTG by publishing a detailed Environmental Impact\n    Statement - or EIS - and several fact sheets. The Final EIS, which\n    includes public comments on the Draft EIS and the NASA responses to\n    those comments, was released in July 2005.\n \n \n  Propulsion\n  ==========\n    The propulsion system (see [FOUNTAINETAL2008], section 3) includes\n    twelve 0.8N thrusters, four 4.4N thrusters, and the hydrazine\n    propellant tank and associated control valves. The titanium\n    propellant/pressurant tank feeds the thrusters through a system\n    filter, a flow control orifice, and a set of latch valves that prevent\n    flow of the fuel until commanded to the open position after launch.\n    Helium was selected as the tank pressurant instead of nitrogen to\n    allow the loading of an additional kilogram of hydrazine. Measurements\n    of tank pressure and temperatures at various points in the system\n    allow the mission operations team to monitor system performance and\n    the amount of fuel remaining in the tank.\n \n    The 16 rocket engine assemblies (REAs) are organized into 8 sets and\n    placed on the spacecraft as shown in Figure 5. Pairs of the 0.8N\n    thrusters (each thruster from a different set) are usually fired to\n    produce torques and control rotation about one of the three spacecraft\n    axes. The one exception to the use of coupled thruster firings to\n    control spacecraft rates is that of controlling rates about the\n    spacecraft X axis during science observations, where uncoupled\n    thruster firings are required to meet the maximum spacecraft drift\n    rates allowed during this operation mode. Control rates for each of\n    the spacecraft axes are shown below in Table II. One pair of the 4.4N\n    thrusters is aligned along the -Y spacecraft axis to provide delta-V\n    for large propulsive events such as trajectory correction maneuvers\n    (TCMs). The second pair of 4.4N thrusters is aligned to produce thrust\n    along the +Y axis. These thrusters are rotated 45 degrees in the YZ\n    plane to minimize the plume impingement on the HGA dish. The net\n    propulsive effect of these thrusters is therefore reduced. They still\n    provide the required redundancy and the ability to generate thrust in\n    both directions without a 180-degree rotation of the spacecraft.\n \n    Each thruster requires a heater to warm its catalyst bed to a minimum\n    temperature prior to use. Each thruster catalyst bed has both a\n    primary and a secondary heater element, with each element drawing\n    approximately 2.2 W of power. Control of the catalyst bed heater\n    circuits is grouped functionally by pairs (to minimize the number of\n    switches required), so that a total of 16 switches control the heater\n    elements, allowing great flexibility to operate the spacecraft safely\n    while drawing the minimum required power. Operational requirements for\n    catalyst bed heater\n \n    The pulse duration and total on-time of each thruster are commanded\n    very precisely, providing accurate control of the total impulse\n    generated during a maneuver. The 0.8N thrusters can be turned on for\n    periods as short as 5 ms. The initial propellant load was allocated\n    between primary mission TCMs, attitude control (including science and\n    communication operations), and primary mission margin. At the end of\n    the primary mission, sufficient margin may allow for an extended\n    mission to one or more objects in the Kuiper Belt. The original margin\n    was augmented during the final mission preparations when the unused\n    dry mass margin was converted to additional propellant.\n \n    Given the mass and moments of inertia at launch, the delta-V\n    propellant cost is approximately 4.9 m/s/kg. A change in spin rate of\n    5 rpm (i.e., the change from the nominal spin rate to zero rpm for\n    3-axis control mode) requires approximately 0.125 kg of hydrazine.\n \n \n    Propellant budget allocations\n    -----------------------------\n                                        delta-V   Propellant\n        Description                         m/s           kg\n        -----------------------------   -------   ----------\n        Primary mission TCM                 110         22.3\n        Attitude control                    N/A         29.3\n        Primary mission margin              132         25.2\n         - original margin allocation      ( 91)       (17.5)\n         - Additional margin obtained      ( 41)       (29.3)\n           from unused spacecraft dry\n           mass allocation\n        Total navigation delta-V            242\n        Total propellant load                           76.8","image_url":"https://pdsregistryimages.psi.edu/images/public/c132a340-fccc-11e9-a91e-4d7880ab36b9.png"},{"tags":["Orbiter"],"tools":[5],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.go","display_name":"GALILEO ORBITER","display_description":"The Galileo Orbiter was launched in 1989.

The system was capable of measuring incident plasma distribution parameters over the energy range 0.1 to 18 keV for protons and approximately 1 to 500 eV for electrons. The high-resolution analyzer with a constant of 9 keV/Q per kV applied to the plates, had a mean plate radius of 9 cm and separation of 0.5 cm. This analyzer was used to measure ions only, and had 26 channeltrons mounted on the semicircular exit to the analyzer. The aperture pointed through a wide slit in the back of the spacecraft high-gain antenna reflector and pointed along the spin axis toward the earth (and therefore the sun). The edges of the antenna reflector limited the viewing of the instrument to 73 deg with respect to the spin axis. The channeltrons covered a range of plus or minus 51 deg. Each channeltron near the center covered 3 deg and approximately 8 deg near the edges of the analyzer. The angular width perpendicular to the long angular width was about 2 deg. In half the spin period the whole cone of half-angle 51 deg centered on the sun was swept out. A medium-energy analyzer with a mean radius of 12 cm and a 1-cm plate separation (constant of 6 keV/Q per kV applied) was used to detect both ions and electrons. The detectors were five flat-surface current collectors. The three center collectors each covered 15 deg and covered the angular range of plus or minus 22.5 deg from the spin axis. The two outside collectors had an angular width of 47.5 deg and were located at plus or minus 46.25 deg from the center of the analyzer. There was a variety of possible operating modes for the experiment; however, the principal mode utilized during the encounter phase was one in which the analyzer plate potential was stepped through its range every one-half revolution of the spacecraft, and all current collectors or channeltrons were read out at the peak flux roll angle. The high and medium resolution analyzers operated independently, so a cross check between these analyzers was possible. The dynamic range for the particle fluxes was from 1.0E+2 to 3.0E+9/(sq cm-s) and the proton temperature down to 2.0E+3 deg K could be ascertained. Data include the interplanetary region.

A Cerenkov counter (C) had four output channels (C1, C2, C3, and CDC) sensitive to electrons having energies above 6, 9, 13, and 1 MeV, respectively. An electron-scatter counter (E) had three output channels (E1, E2, and E3) sensitive to electrons above .16, .26, and .46 MeV. A minimum ionization counter (M) had three output channels, M1 sensitive to electrons having energies greater than 35 MeV, M2 that measured background, and M3 that was sensitive to protons having energies greater than 80 MeV. The last two sensors were scintillator detectors (SP and SE), both of which had energy thresholds of 10 keV for electrons and 150 keV for protons. The sensitivity of the SE detector to protons was about a factor of 10 lower than its sensitivity to electrons. Thus, the SEDC channel effectively measured the electron flux, which could then be subtracted from the SPDC channel response to obtain the proton flux. Several other channels, listed above, required corrections to obtain the fluxes of the species indicated. Three of the channels (CDC, SPDC, and SEDC) were read out through a common electrometer. Due to a malfunction that occurred between launch and Jovian encounter, these three channels produced no usable encounter data. The detector channels could be programmed for readout in any one of four patterns at each of the eight spacecraft bit rate modes. During encounter when the spacecraft was operating in the highest bit rate mode, the minimum time to sample one channel was 1.5 s and the time to obtain a complete scan through all channels was 108 s. Since the directional detectors pointed perpendicular to the spin axis and the spin rate was 5 rpm, pitch-angle measurements were obtained. While the experiment was primarily designated for encounter studies, some data were obtained at low rates in interplanetary space. The last data were taken on December 1, 1993, after which the instrument was turned off to conserve power for other spacecraft experiments and systems.A description of the instrumentation and initial Pioneer 10 results was published in J.

The UVIS will also observe the fluctuations of starlight and sunlight as the sun and stars move behind the rings and the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn, and it will determine the atmospheric concentrations of hydrogen and deuterium.\n\nThe following is a brief description of the components of the UVIS. For a more detailed description, see [ESPOSITOETAL2005] and contained in the DOCUMENT directory of this archive (pending permission).\n\nThe UVIS has two spectrographic channels: the extreme ultraviolet channel and the far ultraviolet channel. The ultraviolet channels are built into weight-relieved aluminum cases, and each contains a reflecting telescope, a concave grating spectrometer, and an imaging, pulse-counting detector. The UVIS also includes a high-speed photometer channel, a hydrogen-deuterium absorption cell channel, and an electronic and control subassembly.\n\nThe extreme ultraviolet channel (EUV) will be used for imaging spectroscopy and spectroscopic measurements of the structure and composition of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn. The EUV consists of a telescope with a three-position slit changer, a baffle system, and a spectrograph with a CODACON microchannel plate detector and associated electronics. The telescope consists of an off-axis parabolic section with a focal length of 100 mm, a 22 mm by 30 mm aperture, and a baffle with a field of view of 3.67 degrees by 0.34 degrees. A precision mechanism positions one of the three entrance slits at the focal plane of the telescope, each translating to a different spectral resolution.\n\nThe spectrograph uses an aberration-corrected toroidal grating that focuses the spectrum onto an imaging microchannel plate detector to achieve both high sensitivity and spatial resolution along the entrance slit. The microchannel plate detector electronics consist of a low-voltage power supply, a programmable high-voltage power supply, charge-sensitive amplifiers, and associated logic.\n\nThe EUV channel also contains a solar occultation mechanism to allow solar flux to enter the telescope when the sun is still 20 degrees off-axis from the primary telescope.\n\nThe far ultraviolet channel (FUV) will be used for imaging spectroscopy and spectroscopic measurements of the structure and composition of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and of the rings. The FUV is similar to the EUV channel except for the grating ruling density, optical coatings, and detector details.  The FUV electronics are similar to those for the EUV except for the addition of a high-voltage power supply for the ion pump.\n\nThe high-speed photometer channel (HSP) will perform stellar occultation measurements of the structure and density of material in the rings. The HSP resides in its own module and measures undispersed (zero-order) light from its own parabolic mirror with a photomultiplier tube detector. The electronics consist of a pulse-amplifier-discriminator and a fixed-level high-voltage power supply.\n\nThe hydrogen-deuterium absorption cell channel (HDAC) will be used to measure hydrogen and deuterium in the Saturn system using a hydrogen cell, a deuterium cell, and a channel electron multiplier (CEM) detector to record photons not absorbed in the cells. The hydrogen and deuterium cells are resonance absorption cells filled with pure molecular hydrogen and deuterium, respectively. They are located between an objective lens and a detector. Both cells are made of stainless steel coated with teflon and are sealed at each end with MgF2 windows.  The electronics consist of a pulse-amplifier- discriminator, a fixed-level high-voltage power supply, and two filament current controllers.\n\nThe UVIS microprocessor electronics and control subassembly consists of input-output elements, power conditioning, science data and housekeeping data collection electronics, and microprocessor control elements.","is_prime":true},{"tags":["Imager","Spectrometer"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vims.co","display_name":"Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer","display_description":"INSTRUMENT: VISUAL AND INFRARED MAPPING SPECTROMETER SPACECRAFT: CASSINI\n\nInstrument Overview ===================\n\nThis section is intended to give the reader a broad overview of the technical aspects of the VIMS instrument (Brown et al 2005). It is not intended to be a detailed technical description nor a complete operator's manual. For a detailed technical description, the reader is directed to papers in the open literature (Miller et al 1996, Reininger et al 1994).\n\nVIMS-V is a multispectral imager covering the spectral range from 0.30 to 1.05 micrometers. VIMS-V is equipped with a frame transfer CCD matrix detector on which spatial and spectral information is simultaneously stored. The CCD is passively cooled in the range -20/+40 degrees C. Radiation collected from VIMS-V telescope is focused onto the spectrometer slit. The slit image is spectrally dispersed by a diffraction grating and then imaged on the CCD: thus, on each CCD column a monochromatic image of the slit is recorded. On-chip summing of pixels allows implementation of a large number of operating modes for different observing conditions.\n\nThe maximum capabilities of VIMS-V are a spectral resolution of 1.46 nm and a spatial resolution of .167 millirads while in the high-resolution mode of operation. On-chip summing of 5 spectral x 3 spatial pixels enables the normal mode of operation whereby VIMS-V achieves a spectral resolution of 7.3 nm and a spatial resolution of .5 millirads. The total field of view of the instrument is 2.4 deg x 2.4 deg, although matching with the IR channel imposes the use of a 1.8 deg x 1.8 deg FOV. In table 1 are listed the main characteristics of the instrument.\n\nVIMS-V is composed of two modules, the optical head and the electronic assemblies, housed in separate boxes. The VIMS-V optical head consists of two units: a scanning telescope and a grating spectrometer, ideally joined at the telescope focal plane where the spectrometer entrance slit is located.  The telescope mirrors are mounted on an optical bench that also holds the spectrometer. In fact, the optical bench is the reference plane for the whole instrument.\n\nThe telescope primary mirror is mounted on a scan unit that accomplishes two specific tasks: a) pointing and b) scanning. The scanning capability enables the .5 millirads IFOV of the nominal mode of operation by a two-step motion of the primary mirror during each integration time; images are produced by scanning across the object target in the down track direction (push-broom technique). The pointing capability is used to image selected target regions in a range about 1.8 degrees around the optical axis, and to observe the Sun, through the solar port, during in-flight radiometric calibration.\n\nAn in-flight calibration unit is located at the entrance of the telescope.  The unit consists of: a) two LEDs for a two-point calibration of the spectral dispersion and b) a solar port for direct solar imaging and hence for radiometric calibration. Because the remote sensing pallet is body-mounted to the spacecraft, to image the Sun the spacecraft is reoriented to form a 20 deg angle with the boresight direction of the instrument and the instrument scan mirror needs to be moved to an angle of 4.8 degrees from boresight. Under these conditions light from the Sun passes through a cutout in the instrument baffle and then through a prism that attenuates the solar radiation and redirects it towards the telescope primary mirror. Due to budget constraints, the high-resolution mode was been implemented and tested, but not calibrated. Calibration will be accomplished during the cruise phase to Saturn.\n\nThe VIMS infrared channel is the culmination of an effort by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in collaboration with the French and Italian space agencies to develop an improved imaging spectrometer for use in spacecraft studies of planetary surfaces and atmospheres. This collaboration resulted in several similar instruments optimized for different planetary targets, most notably the OMEGA instrument, the Mars Observer VIMS, and the CRAF VIMS. Mars Observer VIMS and CRAF VIMS are Cassini VIMS most immediate forebears, but changes made in the VIMS instrument design in response to NASA's demands to reduce the cost of the strawman Cassini VIMS resulted in a substantial heritage from Galileo NIMS. Despite that heritage, which goes so far as to include parts from the Galileo NIMS engineering model, Cassini VIMS is a substantial step beyond NIMS in the evolution of visual and infrared imaging spectrometers.\n\nThe major differences between the Cassini VIMS and the Galileo NIMS lie in the incorporation of a separate visual channel using a frame-transfer, silicon CCD detector with separate foreoptics and analog/control electronics, the inclusion of a radically improved infrared detector with improved order sorting and thermal background rejection, an improved infrared focal plane cooler design, an improved main electronics design, a two-dimensional, voice-coil-actuator-driven, scanning secondary mirror in the infrared foreoptics, a fixed, triply blazed grating in the infrared, a redundant 16 megabit buffer, and a redundant, lossless, hardware data compressor using a unique compression algorithm developed by Yves Langevin. These improvements result in an instrument with substantially greater capability for planetary imaging spectroscopy--so much so that Cassini VIMS is the most capable and complex imaging spectrometer presently flying on a NASA planetary spacecraft.\n\nThe IR channel optics that was successfully deployed as of August 15, 1999, some 50 hours before the time of closest approach during the Cassini Earth Swingby. The visual and IR channels are mounted to a palette that holds them in optical alignment and helps to thermally isolate the instrument from the Cassini spacecraft.  Thermal isolation is particularly important for the infrared channel because thermal background radiation from the IR spectrometer, combined with shot noise from leakage current in the InSb photodiodes of the 256 element linear array detector of the IR channel are the chief sources of noise in measurements obtained with the IR channel. The nominal operating temperature for the IR focal plane is 55-60 K and for the IR foreoptics and spectrometer optics 120 K.\n\nThe Cassini VIMS instrument is mounted on the Cassini spacecraft by means of a palette (called the Remote Sensing Palette or RSP) on which are also mounted the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS), and the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVIS). Mounting of all the Cassini remote sensing instruments on a common palette allows relatively precise boresight alignment of the four instruments, enhancing synergy between the 4 instruments.\n\nScience Objectives ==================\n\nThe VIMS science investigation is focused on the study of the Saturn system and on objects that Cassini encountered during it's cruise to Saturn. The Cassini trajectory uses gravity assists from Venus, Earth and Jupiter to eventually get the Cassini spacecraft to Saturn, so additional opportunities for scientific study of planetary bodies present themselves well ahead of the Cassini Saturn orbital insertion maneuver.\n\nThe Saturn System provides a unique challenge for VIMS. VIMS's capability to acquire the full range of visual-near-infrared wavelengths in two-dimensional maps over a wide variety of illumination and emission angles enables a diverse investigation of chemical, dynamical, and geophysical phenomena. Important targets for VIMS include the surface and atmosphere of Titan, the cloud-rich atmosphere of Saturn, Saturn's rings, and a plethora of icy moons. Observations of both the day and night sides of these objects should lead to increased insights into various phenomena involving both reflection and emission of radiation.  Occultations of the Sun and stars by these objects should provide new insights into the nature of tenuous stratospheric hazes on Saturn and Titan, the structure of faint rings, and atmospheric composition.\n\nCalibration Description =======================\n\nThe main VIMS ground calibration took place at the Jet Propulsion Lab during the months of January and February 1996. The detailed plan for the VIMS ground calibration evolved over a period of approximately 4 years, being completed in mid 1995, roughly 6 months before the actual measurements were to commence. The time frame for the ground calibration was driven by the planned delivery date of the fully integrated VIMS instrument in the September-October period, 1996. Because the VIMS Visual Channel was not completed at the time of the main calibration, only the IR channel was calibrated. The Visual channel was calibrated separately at Officine Galileo (Firenze, Italy) (the instrument provider), in the spring of 1996, and later a small number of operational/performance tests were carried out in late summer of 1996 after the Visual and IR channels were integrated at JPL. As a result of the slip in the schedule for the delivery of the Visual Channel, a substantial recalibration of the instrument has been undertaken while the VIMS is in route to Saturn. The details of the efforts to calibrate the VIMS instrument in flight appear later in this document.\n\nThe main ground calibration of the IR channel was carried out in 6 separate areas: radiometric/flat field response, geometric, polarimetric, spectral, and solar port response. In the early phases of the genesis of the VIMS ground calibration plan, measurement of VIMS stray light rejection performance was also envisioned, but practical difficulties in performing those measurements under vacuum and at the operational temperatures required necessitated elimination the ground based measurements in favor of measurements in flight. Those measurements are discussed later in this document.\n\nThe actual measurements were carried out in the JPL thermal vacuum testing facility in the largest thermal vacuum tank available. The in-flight thermal environment for VIMS was simulated by cooling the interior surfaces of the thermal vacuum tank with liquid N2, and providing a cold target that filled the fields of view of both the visual and infrared channel's passive coolers with a high emissivity surface cooled to 4 K.  In retrospect, the thermal environment of the JPL thermal vacuum tank and the cold target was quite accurate because the temperatures of the instruments optics and focal planes in flight are within a few K of those measured while the instrument was in the test environment. Described in more detail below are the main results of Each of the major calibration tests listed above. For more information on the VIMS calibration during the galilean satellites flyby, see McCord et al 2004.\n\nRADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION\n\nVIMS IR Channel\n\nThe radiometric response of the VIMS IR channel was carried out before launch in the thermal vacuum facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A team of scientists, supported by the instrument engineering team at JPL, designed and carried out these measurements. The team members responsible are Thomas B. McCord (lead), Robert Brown, Angioletta Coradini, Vittorio Formisano, and Ralf Jaumann. Also contributing were Giancarlo Bellucci, Bonnie Buratti, Frank Trauthan, Charles Hibbitts and Gary Hansen. Two sessions were conducted, one in January and the other in July of 1996.  In-flight calibration efforts were conducted during the Venus, Earth and Jupiter flybys and for two star observations.  A workshop was held in Hawaii in February 2001 to review the information obtained. Additional people contributing post launch were Kevin Baines, Roger Clark, and Robert Nelson. More information on the calibration test and data results can be found in Coradini et al 2004.\n\nThe equipment facility during the ground calibration included a JPL thermal vacuum chamber cooled by liquid nitrogen and containing the instrument, which viewed the outside through a window with known optical transmission.  A reflecting collimator fed light from several sources to the instrument.  The calibrated sources were a glow bar and a tungsten lamp and their energy delivered to the instrument was controlled by adjustable iris diaphragms at the exit of the lamps. The light sources and delivery system were covered to eliminate outside light and, during the first session, the tent was purged with dry nitrogen to reduce the effects of the atmosphere gas absorptions (mainly CO2 and H20). Measurements were made at several instrument and focal plane temperatures, but most measurements were made with the focal plane temperature in the range 60.7 to 61.69 K.  Data were acquired at several light levels and integration times, including zero.\n\nThe characteristics of the instrument that were explored were dark current (detector thermal carrier generation and electronic off-sets), background signal (mostly thermal radiation from the chamber window and from outside), linearity of response, ratio of responses at the two gain states, performance of the detector for two different bias levels, and overall radiometric response over the spectral range. The instrument was determined to be linear within the measurement error to detector saturation. The dark current, background, gain ratios and behavior at different bias are reasonable, stable and as expected. The overall spectral responsivity was most difficult to calibrate due to several factors, including an unexpected and unknown (at the time) change in a light source during the calibration effort. This effort has been enhanced during in-flight calibration efforts and the responsivity calibration seems to be converging.\n\nIn-flight calibrations were conducted at Venus only for the visual channel because the cooler cover was not yet removed from the IR channel radiator.  The entire instrument calibration was tested at the Earth-Moon (for the Moon only) and the Jupiter fly-bys and for two star observations. The data are still being analyzed at this writing for the in-flight calibrations, but the general result so far is to further refine the calibrations and to gain better understanding of the instrument performance, which remains as expected.\n\nOne interesting characteristic experienced is the difficulty of achieving precise and stable calibration for sources smaller than the spectrometer slit width (sub-pixel sources). This is because the effective spectral resolution of the spectrometer and the exact location of the source image on the detectors depend on the size of the source and its exact location in the focal plane. Thus, it will be difficult to precisely predict radiometric performance for sub-pixel sources. Nevertheless, for sources that fill the slit, the instrument behavior is normal and as expected. The spectro-radiometric response function as currently known is given in figure 6.1. Improvements and changes are expected with time and more analysis. Thus, the reader is referred to the VIMS Planetary Data System (PDS) archive for appropriate calibrations to be used with flight data.\n\nVIMS Visual Channel\n\nThe VIMS visual channel was constructed and calibrated in Italy, at Officine Galileo (Firenze, Italy). The VIMS-V was has been calibrated in two phase: 1) at the Officine Galileo (Firenze, Italy) premises, prior to the integration with the infrared channel; 2) at JPL after the integration on the remote sensing palette.  The activity carried out at JPL was mainly devoted to geometric measurements; that is, co-alignment of the two channels and measurement of the relative radiometric response. Furthermore, the instrument spatial response (measurement of the image quality through the instrument Modulation Transfer Function and Point Spread Function) were evaluated as part of the Full Functional Tests performed at Officine Galileo (Firenze, Italy) prior to the calibration activity.\n\nVIMS-V was placed inside a vacuum chamber equipped with a thermally stabilized radiator connected to the CCD and capable of keeping the CCD at a temperature in the range -20/+40 deg C under a residual pressure of lower than 10-4 mbar. The chamber has a window (TVC window) with transparency better than 0.9 throughout the entire spectral range. VIMS-V was mounted on two computer-controlled rotating tables for fine positioning around azimuthal and elevation angles. Two lamps were used to cover the full spectral range: a Xenon lamp for the range 0.3 - 0.4 microns, and a Tungsten lamp between 0.4 and 1.035 microns. The lamp with its housing, which includes a condenser and a diffusing screen to improve light uniformity, was positioned at the input slit of a Jobin-Yvon HR640 monochromator capable of better than 0.05 nm resolution (band width at half height) over the VIMS-V spectral range. The monochromator output was then used to illuminate a slit, pinhole or test targets (corresponding to a specific type of test) placed at the focus of an off-axis collimator. The collimated beam was fed to the instrument inside the vacuum chamber.  Unfortunately, the collimated beam has as unknown spectral irradiance; thus, we had to devise a method to measure it. This was achieved using a beam splitter, of known optical properties, placed in the optical path at 45 deg C in front of the chamber window. The reflected portion of the beam was collected by a calibrated photodiode to monitor the irradiance output of the light source set up. An additional calibrated photodiode was placed every 50 nm (or 50 monochrometor steps) directly in front of the collimator to have direct calibration at the collimator aperture.\n\nWith the available collimator only 1/6th of the full VIMS-V FOV could be instantaneously illuminated, thus a time consuming procedure was implemented to repeat a full spectral sweep (0.3 to 1.05 microns in 1 nm steps) to cover the field of view of the instrument.  The radiometric calibration of VIMS-V was as follows. The Unit Response of the instrument is defined as the output in Digital Numbers when the instrument entrance pupil is fed with a light beam of 1 W per square cm, and this beam is collected entirely into a single spectel and into a unit solid angle, for an integration time of 1 s. This quantity was directly measured along with its dependence on wavelength. The spectral calibration was performed in order to evaluate the spectrally weighted center of each channel as well as the spectral width. The spectral width of each Spectel is of 5 times 1.46 nm = 7.33 nm.  For a detailed discussion on the calibration see Capaccioni et al. (1998).\n\nWe note that the radiometric transfer function obtained at OG during on ground calibration of VIMS-V when applied to the Moon and Venus illuminated side is insufficient to remove instrumental effects. Moreover two problems are apparent: a shift in wavelengths of about two nominal pixels and an inadequate removal of instrumental effects, particularly at short wavelengths. So we measured a new unit response function using the Venus and Moon data in the following way.\n\nWe use an Apollo 16 landing site telescopic reflectance spectrum (McCord and Adams, 1973) on a bright area on the Moon surface. This choice is supported by the fact that Apollo 16 landing site is on the lunar highlands where the albedo is particularly high.\n\nGEOMETRIC CALIBRATION\n\nFor VIMS, the primary data product is, for each resolved pixel of a given target, the determination of both the pixel position and the full spectrum from 0.35 to 5.2 microns. To build such spectral images, for each picture element of any given 64 x 64 frame, the viewing direction of each of its 352 contiguous spectral elements (spectels) must be known. Thus, the prime goal of the geometric calibration of VIMS was to determine the relative viewing directions of all 96 VIMS-V and 256 VIMS-IR spectels within the full VIMS Field of View (FOV), in a frame to be referenced to the Cassini spacecraft.\n\nA complexity originates from the basic difference in the way the spectral images are obtained by the two channels: VIMS-V operates in a push-broom mode, acquiring an entire cross-track line simultaneously spread over its spectral dimension (from 0.35 to 1.0 microns) along the second dimension of its CCD detector. The second spatial dimension is acquired either using the S/C drift or the scanning of the VIMS-V telescope secondary mirror.  VIMS-IR uses only a linear array detector, thus it acquires one pixel only spread over its spectral dimension (from 0.85 to 5.2 microns). The cross-track spatial dimension is acquired by scanning the telescope secondary mirror (whiskbroom mode), while the along track dimension is acquired (as for VIMS-V) using either spacecraft drift or scanning the IR telescope's secondary mirror in two dimensions. With two distinct scanning mechanisms, telescopes, and spectrometers, the boresight alignment and the Instantaneous Fields Of View (IFOV) within the full FOV are not identical by design, and in principle, wavelength dependent. The geometric calibration is thus intimately coupled to the determination of these spectral registration effects.\n\nDue to the late delivery of VIMS-V, the ground geometric calibration was performed in steps: the in-depth geometric calibration of VIMS-IR was performed first, prior to the integration with VIMS-V, followed by the geometric calibration of VIMS-V after its integration. After integration, a large misalignment was observed, requiring a global mechanical realignment of both the IR and V channels (out of the calibration chamber), followed by a few final control measurements (back to the calibration chamber) prior to integration with the Cassini spacecraft.  Some in-flight calibrations were performed to assess the actual geometrical characteristics of both channels, when the instrument had reached its proper in-flight thermal regime, late during the cruise towards Jupiter.\n\nDuring the ground calibration, VIMS was mounted on a fixed platform, thermally controlled and under vacuum. A collimator and optical bench assembly was constructed outside of the thermal-vacuum chamber, and viewed through a large window. For the geometric calibration, we chose to image with VIMS, two types of targets, both mounted on an X-Y stage to allow coverage of the entire VIMS FOV. In the target projector plane, one VIMS pixel (0.5 mrad) corresponded to ~ 1 mm. To cover the entire VIMS FOV, the target was 64 mm in size, and the stage was moved by steps of 0.1 mm (1/10 VIMS pixels). The first type of target consisted of linear blades to measure potential spectral registration effects by analyzing for each spectel the pixel response while the blade was moved across the pixel. The other target placed in the projector focal plane consisted of an opaque metallic target with a grid of sub-pixel sized pinholes (0.1 mm in diameter) evenly spaced, and back-illuminated by a tungsten lamp. The complete calibration data products are in the form of tables, one for each spectral channel, giving the viewing direction of each VIMS pixel. Below we summarize some of the main results.\n\nThe IFOVs of both channels were very accurately measured. Averaged over all wavelengths within a given channel, IFOVIR = 0.495 +/- 0.003 mrad, and IFOVVIS = 0.506 +/- 0.003 mrad. Although the differences look small (~ 2 %), they result in a relative VIMS-VIS/VIMS-IR misalignment over the entire 64-pixel FOV that is larger than one pixel, requiring a thorough geometric re-sampling of all image cubes larger than 32 pixels. Prior to launch, the last geometric measurement showed a boresight alignment between VIMS-V and VIMS-IR of better than 0.3 pixels at all wavelengths.  Images coincide independent of wavelength to within < 0.5 pixel in frames up to 12 x 12 pixels.\n\nThe first measurements in flight were performed using both channels to observe the Moon during the Cassini Earth-Moon fly-by (08/18/1999). Those showed a boresight misalignment of VIMS-IR with respect to VIMS-V (-1 pixels, +2 pixels). Because the VIMS-IR had not reached its nominal thermal regime during the Earth-Moon flyby, it was concluded that at least part of misalignment was the result of thermal gradients in the IR channel that would lessen as the Cassini spacecraft moved farther from the Sun and the IR channel cooled. A recent calibration using the Pleiades cluster and the star Fomalhaut (late March, 2001) showed boresight offsets of (-1,0) pixels. The Pleiades observation shows the misalignment variation within the FOV, as illustrated in Figure 8 showing the various stars in the visual (blue pixels, averaged over the first 30 VIS spectels) and the near IR (red pixels, averaged over the first 40 spectels).\n\nThe ground calibration yielded for most IR spectels, the VIMS FOV, leading to spectral geometric 'distortion' maps. For images up to 32 x 32 pixels, all spectral images coincide to better than 1/3 pixel Larger discrepancies appear in the bottom right and top left corners of the frame, where spectral misalignments up to half a pixel are present. This is illustrated in the Figure 9, scaled in mrad, for three IR wavelengths (spectels 103, 150 and 206, at 0.98 microns, 1.75 and 2.68 microns, in red, blue and green respectively), enlarging the four corners and the center of the FOV geometric spectral responses.\n\nFinally, the spectral registration effects measured for the IR spectels were demonstrated very low, as illustrated in the figure: the huge sensitivity of the measurements allow detection of effects at a scale smaller than 1/10 pixel. With this resolution, the larger effects we see between contiguous spectels actually amount for 1/10 px, and in fact result from atmospheric contributions during the calibration (variation of H2O and CO2 features). The only large-scale effect present (black curve) has a very low frequency (at the scale of the entire spectral range), and likely results from optical aberrations within the IR spectrometer. It is both smooth and small enough to minimize the risk of misinterpreting potential large optical contrasts in the observed scene in terms of false spectral signatures.\n\nSPECTRAL CALIBRATION\n\nThe goals of the spectral calibration of VIMS were to measure the spectral response of each VIMS spectral channel to determine the central wavelength and spectral profile of each detector, and its spectral stability as a function of temperature and spatial position within the field of view of the instrument. To achieve this, the tests included: 1) scanning a nearly monochromatic line (using a calibrated grating monochrometer) over the VIMS wavelength range to map the spectral profile of each VIMS detector, 2) transmission spectra of materials with sharp absorption bands, and 3) measuring reflectance spectra of minerals and other targets with VIMS.\n\nThe monochrometer scans were useful for a single position in the full VIMS field of view because the relatively large field of view of the VIMS could not be covered with the narrow exit slit of the monochrometer, and small shifts in wavelength were observed in the monochrometer as a function of distance along the slit. This results because a change in direction along the slit results in a slight change in the field position in VIMS that corresponds to an angular movement. Such changes require a change in the light path through the monochrometer with a corresponding change in the effect output wavelength of the monochrometer. Thus the monochrometer tests were done on axis only.  The monochrometer was typically scanned at 1 nm increments to map out the profile of each VIMS spectral bandpass.\n\nCalibrated transmission filters consisting of a mylar sheet displaying sharp absorption bands in the 1-3.5 micron region, with broader features at longer wavelengths, and Corning glass filters containing rare-earth elements which give sharp absorption features in the visual and near-infrared wavelength regions, and broader absorptions at longer wavelengths were used to cover the full VIMS field of view. Because of their uniformity and stability, the filters were used to determine the stability of the VIMS wavelength response as a function of spatial position, temperature, and time (because two tests were done over a period of about 6 months).\n\nTo measure VIMS response to real targets with spectral features, a set of minerals and other materials were assembled into a spectral target and measured in reflectance. Because the calibration geometry was optimized for other tests, the setup for reflectance measurements was not ideal, so these tests are more qualitative. The light source used to illuminate the samples was set up at relatively large angles to the normal to the surface of the highly scattering surface of the spectral target, the exact viewing geometry is difficult to assess. Furthermore, only vertical samples could be measured, so it was not possible to measure the reflectance of unconstrained, loose particulate samples. Measurements were made of rocks and solid samples that typically had large grains, thus the absorption bands were deep and saturated, but the spectra of these rocks are quite identifiable with the VIMS.\n\nThe spectral calibration tests showed that VIMS is a remarkable instrument, producing spectra comparable in quality to specialized laboratory spectrometers. The large spectral range of the VIMS, ~0.2 to 5.1 microns includes the region of increasing thermal emission at room temperature making the light reflected from the sample difficult to separate from the background thermal emission. The spectral range of VIMS is greater than the spectral output any single convenient laboratory light source, so tests were often done multiple times with different light sources.\n\nSpectral calibration of VIMS occurred in three separate steps. The Visual channel was calibrated separately in Italy prior to integration with the IR channel at JPL. The IR channel was calibrated in the thermal vacuum tests at JPL January 28 to February 5, 1996. The integrated instrument was further tested at the JPL thermal vacuum facility July 16-17, 1996. This final test was limited and only included filter transmission and mineral target tests.\n\nThe spectral calibration resulted in a specification of the wavelength position and bandpass of each VIMS spectral channel across the instrument field of view and as a function of temperature. The VIMS-IR spectral response is identical across the full field of view to within about a nanometer (nm) over the temperature range tested.  The VIMS-IR sampling interval is about 16 nm in the IR, thus a 1-nm shift is a small fraction is < 7% of the sampling interval. The VIMS-V has a sampling interval of ~7 nm and tests show stability to better than about 0.3 nm.\n\nPOLARIMETRIC CALIBRATION\n\nThe VIMS instrument contains no specific polarimetric capability, such as filters or grids, but the design of the grating spectrometer makes it inevitable that the instrument's response will be linearly polarized to some extent. The purpose of the polarimetric calibrations was to characterize this sensitivity, so that its effect on the accuracy of spectra obtained for both polarized and non-polarized targets in the Saturn system can be assessed. In general, spacecraft pointing constraints will determine the roll attitude of the ORS instruments during targeted observations, leaving little opportunity for observations at multiple roll orientations.\n\nMeasurements for the polarization characterization of the VIMS IR channel were carried out in the 10 ft thermal-vacuum tank in Bldg 144 at JPL, during Jan 17-20, 1996.  A target projector was set up with a 26 mm diameter IR linear polarizing filter at the focal plane of a collimator. The target was illuminated by the 1-inch output aperture of an integrating sphere, producing a polarized image of the exit aperture of the sphere at the VIMS focal plane. The polarizer consisted of a ZnSe substrate with a deposited aluminum wire grid, and its polarization efficiency is documented from 2.5 microns to beyond 10 microns.  The average single-polarizer throughput is 38%, while the maximum cross-polarized throughput over the 2.5- to 5.0 microns range is 1.5%. No data on the filter transmission were available below 2.5 microns. A calibrated tungsten source with a Teflon-coated sphere provided adequate SNR out to about 2.5 microns, while a glowbar source with a gold integrating sphere provided adequate SNR at all wavelengths beyond 1.5 midrons.\n\nMeasurements were made at 5 spatial positions of the source in the target plane, on boresight and near the 4 corners of the VIMS field. For each source position, measurements were made at 7 settings of the polarizer, at 30 degs intervals between +90 degs and -90 degs, followed by a sequence of background measurements with the shutter on the light source closed.  Only the VIMS IR channel was available for these measurements.  Three cubes per measurement were co-added and background-subtraction spectra were extracted both for a central spot in the image of the source and for a larger region which included the full output aperture of the sphere.  This was accomplished at each orientation of the polarizer and for each source position.\n\nSOLAR PORT CALIBRATION\n\nThe Solar Calibration Port (henceforth cal port) was installed within the VIMS IR telescope in order to permit the instrument to obtain a strongly attenuated spectrum of the sun during the Cassini mission, which would in turn facilitate reduction of VIMS spectra to an accurate scale of relative reflectance. The cal port is pointed at an angle offset by 20 degrees from the instrument boresight towards the -Z direction, aligned with the UVIS solar occultation port. Attenuation of the incident solar beam by a factor of approx. 2.5 x 10-7 is achieved by (i) the small aperture of the cal port, compared to the main beam and (ii) a series of one 70 degs and five 90 degs reflections from right-angle prisms made of ZnSe. Most of the incident flux is returned out of the entrance aperture by internal reflection in the prisms. The beam exiting the cal port is focussed by the IR telescope optics onto the VIMS-IR entrance slit, and then enters the spectrometer in the normal way. But because the cal port aperture samples only a portion (~0.3%) of the full instrument aperture, the collimated beam illuminates only a small part of the diffraction grating. The optical design ensures that this region overlaps the short- and medium-wavelength blaze regions on the grating, in the ratio 1:3. The solar port does not illuminate the long-wavelength blaze.\n\nThe predicted throughput of the stack of prisms varies smoothly from 1.35 x 10-4 at 0.85 microns to 1.09 x 10-4 at 3.0 microns and 1.04 x 10-4 at 5.0 microns, for radiation linearly polarized in a plane perpendicular to the plane containing the incident and exit beams and to the rulings on the VIMS diffraction grating. The transmission of the orthogonal polarization is less than 1.0 x 10-7.  The output spectrum of a target seen through the cal port differs from that produced by the same source seen on the instrument boresight due to a combination of polarization and partial illumination of the grating blazes. The purpose of the solar cal port calibrations is to establish the ratio of the spectrum of an unpolarized broadband source as seen through the cal port to that of the same source on the instrument boresight.\n\nThe simulated solar source used for the calibration runs was a high-power xenon lamp, illuminating a large, white, teflon-coated integrating sphere.  The output of the sphere illuminated a 1 mrad diameter circular aperture in the focal plane of the calibration projector (equal to the angular size of the sun at 9 AU), after a 90 degs reflection from an aluminum plate. One side of this plate was polished and oriented for specular reflection of the high-intensity beam onto the target for the cal port runs, while the other was sand-blasted to provide diffuse reflected illumination of the target for the boresight runs.\n\nAll measurements were made on July 12, 1996, in the 10 ft thermal-vacuum chamber at JPL. Inside the tank, a deployable periscope-like arrangement with two aluminum mirrors was used to redirect the input beam into the cal port's entrance aperture. The input signal to VIMS thus experienced identical atmospheric paths, with the same number of reflections, for both cal port and boresight runs. Only the IR channel was available for these runs; the VIS channel was calibrated separately at Officine Galileo (Firenze, Italy). For each observation multiple 8 x 8 image cubes were taken, centered manually on the image of the target.\n\nA total of 100 separate solar port image cubes were background subtracted and averaged in sets of 10, and all pixels co-added to produce spectra.  Twenty boresight cubes were processed in identical fashion. Figure 10 shows the average boresight and solar port spectra, at the DN levels originally recorded. The resulting ratio spectrum is displayed in Fig. 15, normalized to an average value of unity. Data for 9 channels at the three filter segment boundaries have been interpolated in both plots.\n\nThe ratio spectrum shows that the cal port sensitivity is relatively low shortward of IR channel 50 (1.7 microns), increases rapidly between channels 50 and 70 to a peak at channel 80 (2.2 microns), and then declines smoothly at longer wavelengths. Oscillations near 2.7 and 4.3 microns are due to imperfect cancellation of CO2 absorption features in the raw spectra. The high-frequency structure beyond of 4.0 microns is an artifact of the array readout.\n\nThe decline in sensitivity of the cal port relative to the main aperture at longer wavelengths is attributable to the lack of illumination of the long-wavelength grating blaze, and to the increasing polarization sensitivity of the IR channel beyond 3 microns (see Sec 7.1.5). The steep drop shortward of 2 microns is, on the other hand, unexplained. Neither the ZnSe prisms nor the several aluminum reflections seem to be capable of causing this effect.  Additional experiments showed no indication of a misalignment in the projector illumination pattern. Previous calibration runs on June 26, 1996, which did not use the external Al plate, did not achieve sufficient SNR at the longest wavelengths. Nevertheless, these earlier results are not consistent with the final runs at short wavelengths, for reasons that are presently unknown. Thus, the solar port ratio spectrum in Fig. 15 must be considered provisional, and subject to revision on the basis of in-flight experience.\n\nViewed through the IR solar cal port, images of a circular target are noticeably elongated. FWHM dimensions are ~2.0 pixels in X, but increase steadily from 2.8 pixels in the Z direction at 1 microns to 4.1 pixels at 5 microns. This may be compared with FWHM sizes for the boresight images of 1.5 x 2.2 pixels for the same target. The elongation of the solar port images is due to diffraction at the elongated rectangular aperture of the cal port (30 mm x 5 mm). Image centroids are fairly stable, varying in X by at most 0.3 pixels and in Z by at most 0.2 pixels. Because of the variable size and slightly wavelength-dependent position of the solar image, it is recommended that solar cal port images be co-added over at least an 8 x 8 pixel region in order to obtain a stable, well-defined spectrum. No precise information is available from the ground calibrations on the absolute pointing of the solar cal port, but this is believed to be within 0.5 degrees (17 pixels) of nominal and will be readily verified with in-flight observations of the sun.","is_prime":true,"tools":[5]},{"tags":["Ion Detector","Electron Detector","Mass Spectrometer"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:caps.co","display_name":"Cassini Plasma Spectrometer","display_description":"The CAPS instrument was comprised of three sensors: the Electron Spectrometer (ELS), the Ion Beam Spectrometer (IBS), and the Ion Mass Spectrometer (IMS).

It was specially designed to measure sharply defined ion beams expected in the solar wind at 9.5 AU, highly directional rammed ion fluxes encountered in Titan's ionosphere, and anticipated field-aligned auroral fluxes. The IMS sensor was designed to measure the composition of hot, diffuse magnetospheric plasmas and low-concentration ion species with an atomic resolution M/delta M ~70 and, for certain molecules, (such as N2+ and CO+), effective resolution as high as ~2500. The three sensors were mounted on a motor-driven actuator that rotates the entire instrument over approximately one-half of the sky every 3 minutes.\n \n \n  Scientific Objectives\n  =====================\n \nThe Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) had many complimentary science objectives during the Cassini mission.  The CAPS objectives were as follows:\n \n      - Perform in-situ studies of dust-plasma interactions in Saturn's magnetosphere\n      - Study Saturnian auroral phenomena\n      - Observe Saturn Kilometric radiation (SKR) generation\n      - Study magnetospheric external and internal boundaries, structures and plasma domains (including flux tubes)\n      - Study microphysics of the bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause and magnetotail\n      - Study magnetospheric dynamics (driven by solar wind, internal rotation, substorms, radial transport, and mass loading)\n      - Study the composition of the ionosphere, exposphere and atmosphere at Titan\n      - Study the interaction of Titan's upper atmosphere and ionosphere with Saturn's magnetosphere (precipitation, ion pickup)\n      - Study the structure of upstream, bow shock, wake, and flux tube regions around Titan\n      - Determine composition of ionized molecules originating from the ionosphere and the icy satellite's expospheres\n      - Study the composition of the exposphere and surfaces around icy satellite\n      - Look at the interaction of the magnetosphere (precipitation, ion pickup) with icy satellite exosphere\n      - Study the structure of upstream, bow shock, wake, and flux tube regions around the icy satellites\n      - Study the composition of ring exposphere and ring particle surfaces, characterize ring/magnetoshere interactions, dust-plasma interactions, ring particle dynamics and erosion, and study the interactions of ring plasma with Saturn's ionosphere\n \n \n \n  Operational Considerations\n  ==========================\n \n    The ELS measured differential electron velocity distributions at densities as low as 10**(-3) cm**(-3). The measurement range extended from 1 eV to 28 keV. The lower end of this range, allowed detailed studies of secondary electron fluxes that contribute to ionization and chemical processes taking place at Titan and elsewhere. At tens of keV ELS contributed to studies of trapped electrons and those associated with saturnian aurora. Throughout its energy range ELS provided a global survey of plasma density, temperature and electron pitch angle distributions that were needed to derive a comprehensive view of plasma dynamics within the magnetosphere and, for roughly 50% of the mission, in the solar wind and magnetosheath.\n\n    The large amount of time that Cassini spent in the solar wind during the Cassini tour presented the opportunity to study both the solar wind's intrinsic characteristics and its interactions with the magnetosphere of Saturn, and the comet-like magnetosphere of Titan. The IBS energy and angular resolution (few percent and ~2 degrees respectively) provided the capability of making solar wind measurements, and for observing ion ram fluxes at Titan and auroral ion beams. The IBS energy range extends from 1 eV up to 50 keV.\n\n    The IMS was designed to provide comprehensive measurements in all regions of the magnetosphere. IMS relies on time-focused optics combined with carbon foil technology. It was designed to separate atomic species with high resolution, and to identify isobaric molecular species such as CH4+, NH2+, and O+ (all with M/Q = 16, where M/Q is the mass/charge ratio) or N2+ and CO+ (M/Q = 28) that would otherwise have required a very large conventional instrument to achieve. Because of its 1 eV to 50 keV energy range IMS was also used to study the composition of Titan's ionosphere at a few eV, complementing INMS [WAITEETAL2004], and to study energetic trapped ions, complementing the MIMI/CHEMS investigation [KRIMIGISETAL2004].","is_prime":true,"tools":[]},{"tags":["Dust Detector"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:cda.co","display_name":"Cosmic Dust Analyzer","display_description":"The Cosmic Dust Analyser instrument (CDA) on the Cassini orbiter is the successor of the dust detectors flown on the Ulysses and the Galileo spacecraft.

The DA measures the electric charges carried by the dust particle, the impact direction, the impact speed, mass, and the chemical composition, whereas the HRD is only capable to determine the mass for particles with a known speed.

Of particular interest is the high-altitude region, between 900 and 1000 km, where the methane and nitrogen photochemistry is initiated that leads to the creation of complex hydrocarbons and nitriles that may eventually precipitate onto the moon's surface to form hydrocarbon-nitrile lakes or oceans.

Instrument sensitivity is greatest in the first mode, because the ram pressure of the inflowing gas can be used to enhance the density of the sampled non-reactive neutrals in the closed source ante-chamber. In this mode, neutral species with concentrations on greater than approximately 1.0E04 per cubic centimeter will be detected (compared with approximately 1.0E05 per cubic centimeter in the open source neutral mode). For ions the detection threshold is on the order of 1.0E-02 per cubic centimeter at Titan relative velocity of (6 kps). The INMS instrument has a mass range of 1 to 99 Daltons and a mass resolution M/(deltaM) of 100 at 10% of the mass peak height, which will allow detection of heavier hydrocarbon species and of possible cyclic hydrocarbons such as C6H6.","is_prime":true,"tools":[]},{"tags":["Magnetometer"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mag.co","display_name":"Dual Technique Magnetometer","display_description":"ABSTRACT\n  ========\nThe dual technique magnetometer system onboard the Cassini orbiter is described. This instrument consists of vector helium and fluxgate magnetometers with the capability to operate the helium device in a scalar mode. This special mode is used near the planet in order to determine with very high accuracy the interior field of the planet. The four-year orbiting Cassini mission will lead to a detailed understanding of the Saturn/Titan system. In addition to the prime scientific measurement of the planetary field, the instrument will also make measurements of the planetary magnetosphere, and the interactions of Saturn with the solar wind, of Titan with its environments, and of the icy satellites within the magnetosphere.\n \n  INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION\n  ======================\nThe MAG instrument comprises a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) and a vector helium magnetometer capable of operating in both vector and scalar mode (V/SHM). The instrument is intended to measure small changes in fields spanning four orders of magnitude with extremely high sensitivity. This goal is achieved in part by mounting the sensors on an 11-metre spacecraft boom; the V/SHM at the end of the boom, the FGM halfway along. The magnetometer boom distances the sensors from the magnetic field associated with the spacecraft and its subsystems, and especially from spacecraft-generated temporal field variations. Spacing the sensors at different distances along the boom allows the spacecraft fields to be better characterised and removed from the observations. However, mounting the sensors on a boom could result in their orientation with respect to the spacecraft axes changing from time to time, for example after spacecraft manoeuvres. A means of sensor-alignment determination has been provided by the Cassini project - the Science CAlibration Subsystem, SCAS. This system consists of two, perpendicular, coils rigidly mounted on the spacecraft body with a known alignment to the spacecraft axes. These coils produce well-defined magnetic fields on command which can be detected by the sensors and used to correct for any changes in sensor orientation.\n\nBoth magnetometers are capable of measuring the magnetic-field vector at rates from 0 Hz up to 10 Hz (VHM) or at least 30 Hz (FGM). The VHM optimises low-frequency vector measurements in weak fields. The FGM is best suited to high-frequency measurements and can operate over an extremely wide dynamic range, from very weak fields up to Earth's strong field.\n\nThe twin-sensor configuration contributes to overall instrument reliability; if one sensor fails, field measurements can be made with the other sensor, with sufficient performance to achieve many of the major objectives of the investigation. Reliability has been further increased by the provision of redundant instrument power supplies and data processing units, and by careful selection of electronic components that can survive the radiation environments encountered during the long cruise phase of the mission and in the Saturnian system. The VHM provides the stability needed to maintain calibrations, obtained in the solar wind, whilst Cassini is inside the Saturnian magnetosphere for long periods during the four-year tour.\n\nAn implicit feature of scalar or resonance magnetometers are null zones which arise if the ambient field falls outside a cone of 45 degrees half angle with respect to the optical axis of the magnetometer. These null zones result in the signal being dramatically weakened, causing the absolute accuracy of the instrument to suffer. When Cassini is inside 4 RS a requirement has been placed on the mission to avoid spacecraft orientations which cause the planetary field to lie within the null zones of the SHM.\n\nOther features of the instrument that have been driven by the characteristics of the mission and by the design of the spacecraft are to be found in the data processing unit (DPU). The DPU contains a bus interface unit (BIU), provided by the Cassini project for interfacing to the onboard data handling subsystem (CDS) bus. In line with the spacecraft design, the DPU is capable of handling Packet Telemetry and Telecommands, and features a flexible telemetry storage and generation scheme to support the multiple telemetry modes of the spacecraft. The Tour operations concept requires that the DPU is able to handle trigger commands which initiate multiple actions within the instrument (macro commanding). Further, in order to optimise the analysis of discrete events such as shock crossings, a snapshot capability has been implemented by which up to 16 Mbytes of data can be stored for later downlink at higher time resolution than normal. This capability can be initiated by command or triggered by pre-defined events.\n\nMagnetic-field information is also needed by other investigations on the spacecraft. To this end magnetic-field data are made available to onboard users every second. These onboard ancillary data are raw and uncalibrated vectors, the data source being selectable by command between the two sensors.\n\nIn total, the instrument consists of the two boom-mounted sensors, subchassis #1 (an assembly containing electronics for the FGM, VHM and SHM, the heater-control electronics, the power supplies and power-management system) and subchassis #2 (an assembly containing the data processing unit). Both subchassis are mounted in bay 4 of the Orbiter upper equipment module (UEM).

The spacecraft element was further distinguished in being distributed among several subsystems on the Cassini Orbiter.  Cassini Radio Science can be regarded as a solar-system-sized instrument observing at microwave frequencies, with one end of the radio path on the spacecraft and the other end at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) stations on the ground.\n\nThe Radio Science 'instrument' operated in two fundamental modes, depending on whether the microwave optical path had one or two legs.  For 'two-way' measurements, the 'uplink' signal from the ground could be a single carrier at either X-band (7.2 GHz) or Ka-band (34 GHz); or both carriers could be transmitted at the same time.  The spacecraft radio equipment then acted as a repeater, collecting the carrier signal with the spacecraft High Gain Antenna (HGA), transforming it to one or more 'downlink' frequencies (2.3 GHz, 8.4 GHz, or 32 GHz), amplifying and re-collimating it, and sending it back to Earth.  The returned signal was detected using DSN ground receiving equipment, amplified and downconverted, and recorded for later analysis.\n\nUplink signals were generated by the DSN exciter, using the local frequency and timing system as a reference.  At Launch and Cruise, this reference was a Hydrogen Maser.  Note:  in the future, these masers could be combined with a Compensated Sapphire Oscillator (CSO) to meet Radio Science requirements for increased stability. The uplink signals were amplified, radiated through feed horns, and collimated by a large parabolic ground antenna, which was continuously aimed at the Cassini spacecraft.  The actual transmission frequencies could be adjusted to allow the spacecraft receivers to lock to the uplink signals and to compensate, in finite steps, for the main part of the Doppler effect between the Earth and the Cassini Orbiter.\n\nFor one-way measurements, the signal source was on board the Cassini Orbiter.  The output from an extremely stable on-board reference oscillator (the Ultrastable Oscillator, or USO) was transformed to downlinks at S-band (2.3 GHz), X-band (8.4 GHz), or Ka-band (32 GHz) by elements in the Radio Frequency Subsystem (RFS) and Radio Frequency Instrument Subsystem (RFIS).  These signals were amplified and radiated through the HGA toward Earth. After passing through the medium of interest (plasma, rings, a neutral atmosphere, or gravitationally curved space), the perturbed signal was collected by a DSN antenna, amplified and downconverted, and recorded for later analysis.\n\nThe spacecraft part of the Cassini Radio Science instrument is described immediately below; that is followed by a description of the DSN (ground) part of the instrument.","is_prime":true,"tools":[]},{"tags":["Dust Detector"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:hrd.co","display_name":"High Rate Detector","display_description":"Overview\n========\n \nThe High Rate Detector (HRD) is part of the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) on the Cassini mission payload.  The overall objective of the HRD is to carry out quantitative measurements of particle flux and mass distribution throughout the Saturn ring system. The particle impact rate and particle mass distribution will be determined with respect to Saturnian distances, distance from the rings, and to magnetospheric coordinates.  The particle mass range covered by the HRD (assuming a particle impact velocity of 15 km/s) ranges from 8x10^-13 to 8x10^-8 g for differential and cumulative flux measurements, and > 8x10^-8 g for cumulative flux measurements.  For full information about the HRD instrument, see Srama et al. (2004).\n \nGeneral Description\n===================\n \nThe HRD was designed, built and tested at the University of Chicago and measures differential and cumulative particle fluxes. The HRD has a high counting rate capability (up to 10^4 random impacts/s with <5% corrections) which will be particularly important during Saturn ring plane crossings, where fluxes are large enough to saturate the counting rate of DA (~1 c/s).\n\nThe HRD has significant inheritance from the University of Chicago Dust Counter and Mass Analyzer instrument (DUCMA) flown earlier on the Vega-1 and Vega-2 spacecraft to Comet Halley (Perkins et al., 1985). The instrument employs the dust particle detection technique described by Simpson and Tuzzolino (1985) and consists of two polyvinylidene fluoride sensors with associated electronics. The PVDF sensors are round in shape with areas of 50 cm^2 and 10 cm^2 respectively, and are mounted together as a unit on the front of the HRD electronics box. For images showing the geometry of the sensors see the figures in Srama et al. (2004). The HRD detects individual particles impacting the PVDF sensors and provides continuous measurements of cumulative particle fluxes for particle masses greater than four mass thresholds for each of the two sensors (see Table I).\n\nThe HRD is an independent instrument containing its own memory and processor. The only interface to the Dust Analyzer (DA) of the CDA is via the power and data cables. HRD power is supplied by the DA main electronics and data transfer responds by latching the appropriate data into the HRD data output register. The latching of the data generates an interrupt to DA indicating that the data is ready to be read by DA and stored into DA memory.\n\nThe HRD is rigidly mounted to the DA so that as the CDA turntable is rotated, the HRD scans different particle arrival directions.

This can be achieved only with a sufficiently stable PRL signal over the duration of the descent (delta f <~ 0.4 Hz at S-band) in order to exclude contamination of the measurement by oscillator drift. The transmitter's frequency stability is guaranteed by using an ultrastable oscillator (USO) to generate the PRL carrier signal.

Absorption of UV light drives photochemical reactions, leading to changes in atmospheric composition and the production of atmospheric aerosols. The size, shape, composition and distribution of aerosols and cloud particles determine their optical properties and their ability to absorb sunlight and emit thermal infrared radiation. Thus they play a key role in the atmosphere's thermal balance. The net radiative heating or cooling rate provides the forcing for atmospheric dynamics, which in turn can affect the distribution of aerosol and cloud particles and influence climate. The composition, thermal balance, dynamics and meteorology of the atmosphere also affect (and are affected by) the nature of the surface. Surface images in reflected sunlight, together with near-IR reflection spectra, can reveal the nature of the surface and its interactions with atmospheric processes.

GCMS is used by ACP for about 20% of its operating time, based on a cooperative agreement between Service d'Aeronomie du CNRS (ACP) and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GCMS).\n \nScientific Objectives\n=====================\n \nThe approach for selecting ACP's scientific objectives was to rely on the micro-physics models and on the results of specific laboratory studies. Two methods of producing Titan-like aerosols in the laboratory have been investigated. The first involves identifying these aerosols within the complex organic material that is often observed in the laboratory from simulating the photolytic and radiolytic processes expected in Titan's atmosphere. This material roughly corresponds to what Sagan's group labels 'tholins'. The second route for producing the yellowish aerosols that might correspond to those of Titan is by polymerising organic molecules using UV. The best candidate is C2H2, which polymerises more easily than C2H4 or HCN. These polymers are expected to form the aggregates that are needed to reconcile polarimetric and photometric results [WEST&SMITH1991; CABANEETAL1993; RANNOUETAL1994]. The optical properties of tholins and C2H2 polymers are in agreement with Voyager's observations. The chemical processes leading to these different particle types are not expected to occur in the same altitude ranges, owing to the diversity of the possible energy sources and their related vertical distribution. The polymerisation of C2H2 through the action of solar UV photons is expected, from current modelling, to yield C2nH2 at altitudes greater than ~ 500 km. The synthesis, in large amounts, of polymers of the form (C2H2)n in the lower stratosphere may be considered as rather unlikely, but depends on how the acetylene polymerises long-ward of 190 nm [CHASSEFIERE&CAB1995]. The formation of C-H-N tholin oligomers by the action of suprathermal Saturn plasma electrons, around 900-1000 km, or of energetic radiation belt particles at 350-400 km altitude, is shown to be the most plausible mechanism for explaining the haze's formation. Laboratory experiments providing the best reproduction of Titan's stratospheric conditions are needed to test, for example, the gas phase behaviour of tholin aerosols, and the optical properties of tholin or poly-C2H2 particles. In the low stratosphere, aerosol particles settling down from the upper levels may act as condensation nuclei. Below ~ 80 km, this should lead to the deposition of thin layers (< 0.01 um) of condensed gases (e.g. HC3N, HCN, C4H10) on the sub-um particles. This first stage is followed by a more consistent increase in the particle size, up to a few um, where the condensation of CO2, C3H8, C2H2 and C3H6 occurs, between 67 km and 63 km [FREREETAL1990]. The main condensation processes occur near the tropopause, with the condensation of C2H6 below 62 km, and in the troposphere, where CH4 and N2 condense on the resulting particle, which may yield cloud droplets ( ~ 100 um, see Toon et al., 1992). Another source of condensation nuclei may be the particles produced directly at these altitudes by the radiolysis of organic gases. The energy deposition of cosmic rays peaks near 60 km and, as on Earth, lightning may exist in the low troposphere. Tholins obtained from the sparking of He-CH4 and N2-CH4 mixtures have been studied with the ACP experiment in mind [ISRAELETAL1991; RAULINETAL1992]. The pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py-GC) of tholins produced at 77 K shows them to include saturated and unsaturated carbon chains in their structure; N-containing groups appear in the case of N2-CH4 sparking. The thermal desorption profile of these tholins clearly showed two peaks, the first corresponding to the distillation of condensed species, the second to the pyrolysis. The mass spectrometer (MS) study of the evaporated oligomers and pyrolysis products showed that a wide range of alkylated aromatic compounds evolved from the sample, which indicates that such solids contain a 3-D polymer with a high degree of branching.","is_prime":true,"tools":[]},{"tags":["Sensor Package"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ssp.hp","display_name":"Surface Science Package","display_description":"The SSP experiment consists of nine separate sensors that are designed to measure a wide range of physical properties of Titan's lower atmosphere, surface, and sub-surface.

Scientific data, health and status signals are\n      transmitted at 2273.0 MHz over a +/- 1 MHz bandwidth with\n      nominal power of 5 Watts and peak power of 7 Watts.  The\n      radiated signal is right-hand circularly polarized (RCP).\n      The command link is received at 2093.0542 MHz over a +/- 1\n      MHz bandwidth.\n \n \n    S-Band Transponder\n    ------------------\n      The Loral/Conic S-Band transponder is a standard, off the\n      shelf, S-Band transponder that combines the receiver and\n      transmitter into one unit.  The S-band transponder supports\n      the essential communications functions needed for tracking,\n      telemetry, and command of Lunar Prospector.  The transponder\n      receives commands from the ground station along with signals\n      inserted on the uplink for ranging purposes and transmits\n      scientific data and telemetry from the spacecraft to the\n      ground.\n \n      The receiver/detector section of the transponder detects\n      S-band uplink signals, demodulates the 250 bps lunar command\n      signal, and outputs it as binary command data and bit timing\n      to command and data handling.  Ranging signals are also\n      demodulated and remodulated onto the downlink carrier to\n      provide range information to ground equipment when desired.\n      Ranging can be commanded ON or OFF.\n \n      The transmitter/baseband section of the transponder receives\n      data from the Command And Data Handling (C&DH) electronics at\n      a rate of 300 bps or 3600 bps, converts it from NRZ-L to\n      NRZ-M format and then applies rate 1/2, k=7 convolutional\n      encoding for error protection when convolutional encoding is\n      enabled.  The encoded data BPSK modulates an internal 1.024\n      MHz subcarrier which in turn phase modulates the downlink\n      carrier for transmission to the ground station.\n      Convolutional encoding can be commanded ON or OFF.\n \n \n    Antenna System Overview\n    -----------------------\n      The Lunar Prospector antennas provide scientific data and\n      telemetry links between the satellite and the ground.  Both\n      antennas transmit and receive RCP over their main beams.\n \n      The antenna used to complete the command and initial\n      telemetry link is a conical spiral.  This antenna has an\n      omnidirectional pattern from 0 to over 100 degrees from\n      the +z (spin) axis of the spacecraft.  A gain of better than\n      -1 dBi is achieved to angles 60 degrees from the +z axis,\n      -3 dBi to angles 90 degrees from the +z axis, and -5 dBi to\n      angles 100 degrees from the +z axis.  Spacecraft obstructions\n      are not a factor until 148 degrees, where the antenna gain is\n      approximately -15 dBi.\n \n      Once LP reached lunar orbit, the scientific data and\n      telemetry were transmitted by a medium gain antenna --\n      a bifilar helix wrapped around a metal core.  The\n      structural loads on the helix are eliminated by\n      enclosing it in a radome/support structure.  This also\n      supports the omni antenna on the top of the structure.\n      The medium gain antenna beam is a fan extending from\n      85 to 95 degrees from the +z (spin) axis of the spacecraft.\n      For the 90 degree roll cut the maximum gain is 8.5 dBi and\n      the minimum gain is 6.85 dBi.  The average gain is 7.75 dBi\n      and the phase ripple is 13 degrees.\n \n \n    Antenna Selector Switch\n    -----------------------\n      Under normal operating conditions, two way communications can\n      be maintained between Lunar Prospector and a ground station\n      having an 18-meter antenna using just the omnidirectional\n      antenna, so long as the earth is within view of the\n      spacecraft.\n \n      Switching from the omni to the helix antenna (and vice versa,\n      since the switch latches in the last commanded position) must\n      be commanded from the ground.  Switching the transmitter to\n      the medium gain helix increases the margin, but is not\n      necessary to support the Lunar Prospector mission.  The two\n      commands, Transmitter to MGA and Transmitter to Omni, are\n      used to connect the transmitter to the helix (medium gain\n      antenna) and the Omni (low gain antenna) respectively.  The\n      antenna switch is a break-before-make switch specified to be\n      capable of handling at least 5W RF power without any\n      indication of corona or voltage breakdown.  The switch can\n      sustain at least 50,000 switching cycles for a period in\n      excess of two years on-orbit operation.\n \n \n    Communications Telemetry\n    ------------------------\n      Telemetry is available from the S-band transponder and the\n      antenna selector switch to enable operators to monitor the\n      state of these devices.\n \n      Received signal strength, receiver voltage, loop stress,\n      transmitter voltage, transmitter output power, and\n      transmitter temperature are analog signals; carrier lock\n      status, transmitter on/off, coherent on/off, subcarrier\n      oscillator on/off, convolutional encoding on/off and ranging\n      on/off are discrete signals provided by the transponder.\n \n      The antenna selector switch also provides a discrete\n      indication of switch position.  The transmitter output power\n      is monitored with a circuit that couples a sample of the RF\n      output and conditions it to produce a 0 to 5 Vdc output.\n \n \n  Science Objectives\n  ==================\n    The radio science experiment that was conducted with Lunar\n    Prospector was a radio tracking experiment in which the\n    magnitude and direction of the planet's gravity field were\n    derived from the Doppler (and, sometimes, ranging)\n    measurements.\n \n \n    Gravity Measurements\n    --------------------\n      Measurement of the gravity field provides significant\n      constraints on inferences about the interior structure of the\n      moon.  Precise, detailed study of the spacecraft motion in\n      lunar orbit can yield the mass distribution of the planet.\n      Lunar topographic data (e.g.  Clementine data) forms a\n      critical adjunct to these measurements since only after the\n      gravitational effects are adjusted for topography can the\n      gravity anomalies be interpreted geophysically.\n \n      Studies of the gravity field emphasize both the global field\n      and local characteristics of the field.  The first task is to\n      determine the global field.  Doppler and range tracking\n      measurements yield accurate spacecraft trajectory solutions.\n      Simultaneously with reconstruction of the spacecraft orbit,\n      observation equations for field coefficients and a small\n      number of ancillary parameters can be solved.  This type of\n      gravity field solution is essential for characterizing\n      tectonic phenomena and can also be used to study localized\n      features.\n \n      'Short-arc' line-of-sight (LOS) Doppler tracking measurements\n      obtained when the Earth-to-spacecraft line-of-sight is within\n      a few degrees of the orbit plane provide the highest\n      resolution of local features.  The results from this type of\n      observation typically are presented as contoured acceleration\n      profiles of specific features (e.g., craters, volcanoes,\n      etc.) or line-of-sight acceleration maps of specific regions.\n      The high spatial resolution of these products makes them\n      especially useful to geophysicists for study of features in\n      the size range of 30 to 1,000 km.  Because of the relative\n      simplicity of the data analysis, results can be available\n      within a few weeks after the data are collected.  However,\n      more accurate LOS results can be obtained by referencing the\n      LOS accelerations with respect to a gravity model.  This\n      removes biases in the LOS accelerations that would normally\n      be there as a result of spacecraft orbit error.  With this\n      approach, delivery of the LOS data follows development and\n      delivery of the gravity model.\n \n \n  Operational Considerations - Spacecraft\n  =======================================\n \n    Receiver Performance\n    --------------------\n      The receiver section of the Lunar Prospector transponder is a\n      dual-conversion, superhetrodyne design that down-converts the\n      RF uplink carrier to a 2nd IF frequency (18.3 MHz) for\n      baseband processing by the acquisition circuitry of the\n      detector assembly.  The receiver is followed by a detector\n      assembly that locks a local VCXO to the signal and outputs\n      detected ranging, telecommand, and telemetry outputs.\n \n      The transponder receiver can acquire an uplink carrier with\n      center frequency 2093.0542 MHz +/- 150 KHz, within 1 minute\n      after turn-on.  Recent tests showed the transponder acquired\n      and maintained lock approximately +/- 280 kHz about the\n      center frequency, which is well beyond the end of life (EOL)\n      requirements.  The unit is designed to perform as specified\n      for any signal between -125 dBm and -40 dBm, a dynamic range\n      of 85 dBm.  Following removal of an RF input of + 3 dBm, the\n      receiver will perform as specified within 10 seconds.\n \n      At -20 degrees Celsius , the best lock frequency averaged\n      2093.0655 MHz +/- 3.232 kHz, as contrasted to 2093.0216 +/-\n      3.718 kHz at + 65 degrees Celsius.  Unfortunately\n      insufficient data is available to reliably fit a curve\n      between the extremes.  The two available data points suggest\n      there is little change between -20 and +25 degrees Celsius.\n      Frequency at turn-on is expected to be close to the 2093.0655\n      MHz value.\n \n      The receiver is capable of acquiring and tracking an RF\n      signal over a +/- 90 KHz search range in less than or equal\n      to 17.5 seconds when the unmodulated signal level is greater\n      than or equal to -125 dBm.  During recent tests, the\n      transponder acquisition threshold was -131 dBm, exceeding the\n      EOL requirement.  The uplink command threshold, measured at\n      -131 dBm also exceeds EOL requirements.  The transponder can\n      track modulated or unmodulated carriers with a maximum\n      doppler rate of 600 Hz/sec.\n \n      Transponder range delay, measured at approximately 1350 nsec,\n      more than meets the requirement to not exceed 1500 nsec.\n \n \n    Transmitter Performance\n    -----------------------\n      The transmitter is designed to provide a nominal RF output of\n      5 watts by end of life.  Telemetry data is converted from\n      NRZ-L to NRZ-M form and then, if so commanded, rate 1/2\n      convolutionally encoded prior to being BPSK modulated onto\n      the 1.024 MHz subcarrier for downlinking, with or without\n      turnaround ranging signals.  The resulting signal is linearly\n      phase modulated onto the downlink RF carrier.  Turning off\n      the subcarrier will result in loss of downlink data.\n \n      In noncoherent mode, the transmit frequency of 2273 MHz is\n      determined by an internal crystal oscillator.  The oscillator\n      stability is +/- 25 ppm at 1 year and +/- 30 ppm at 3 years\n      following acceptance test for the transponder.  In coherent\n      mode, the transmitter frequency is derived from the received\n      carrier VCXO signal by the ratio 240/221.\n \n \n    Restrictions and Constraints\n    ----------------------------\n      The main constraint of the communication system is keeping\n      the orientation of the communication cone toward earth.\n \n \n  Calibration Description - Spacecraft\n  ====================================\n    No information available.\n \n \n  Principal Investigators\n  =======================\n    The Principal Investigator for the gravity investigation was\n    Alexander S. Konopliv.\n \n \n  Instrument Section / Operating Mode Descriptions - Spacecraft\n  =============================================================\n    The transponder can be operated in either a noncoherent or\n    coherent mode to support range rate determination.  In the\n    former case, the downlink carrier is derived from an onboard\n    oscillator that is tuned to the assigned downlink frequency; in\n    the latter case, the downlink carrier frequency is locked to\n    the uplink frequency at ratio of 240/221.  Coherent operation\n    can be commanded ON or OFF.\n \n    Lunar Prospector transmitter output power is greater than or\n    equal to 5 Watts over the life of the mission.  Using the\n    omnidirectional antenna, 5W is sufficient to close the downlink\n    with more than 3 dB margin for data transmitted at a 3600 bps\n    rate.  When enabled, rate 1/2 convolutional encoding increases\n    the physical symbol rate to 7200 sps on the downlink.\n \n \n  Instrument Overview - DSN\n  =========================\n    Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near\n    Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise\n    the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with\n    several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High\n    Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m standard (STD)], associated\n    electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity at each\n    complex is radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry\n    data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is\n    possible in several radio-frequency bands, the most common\n    being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a\n    wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-\n    3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kw are\n    available.\n \n    Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded\n    waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis\n    of the received coding allows navigators to determine the\n    distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the\n    carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight\n    spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used\n    to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity\n    fields of objects near the spacecraft.\n \n    Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have\n    propagated through or been scattered from target media.\n    Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with\n    surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer\n    physical and electrical properties of the target.\n \n    Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.\n    See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument\n    description or the data set description for specifics.\n \n    The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion\n    Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the\n    U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n    Specifications include:\n \n      Instrument Id                  : RSS\n      Instrument Host Id             : DSN\n      Pi Pds User Id                 : N/A\n      Instrument Name                : RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM\n      Instrument Type                : RADIO SCIENCE\n      Build Date                     : N/A\n      Instrument Mass                : N/A\n      Instrument Length              : N/A\n      Instrument Width               : N/A\n      Instrument Height              : N/A\n      Instrument Manufacturer Name   : N/A\n \n    For more information on the Deep Space Network and its use in\n    radio science investigations see the reports by\n    [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993], [ASMAR&HERRERA1993], and [ASMARETAL1995].\n    For design specifications on DSN subsystems see [DSN810-5].\n    For an example of use of the DSN for Radio Science see\n    [TYLERETAL1992].\n \n \n  Subsystems - DSN\n  ================\n    The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral\n    part of the Radio Science instrument, along with other\n    receiving stations and the spacecraft Radio Frequency\n    Subsystem.  Their system performance directly determines the\n    degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their\n    system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the\n    results of the experiments.

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The\n      DMC receives and archives most of the information from the\n      NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their\n      operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well\n      as the handling and displaying of any responses to control\n      directives and configuration and status information received\n      from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The\n      effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and\n      archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.\n      Communication among the various subsystems is done using a\n      Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a\n      network interface unit (NIU).\n \n      DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the\n      Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and\n      Control (LMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for\n      Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict\n      sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna\n      pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and\n      then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate\n      subsystems via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in\n      the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.\n      The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm\n      messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels\n      for the DSP.  Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is\n      done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform\n      some of the functions performed by the LMC.  There are two\n      CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC\n      The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if\n      necessary.\n \n      The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor\n      and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to\n      support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might\n      include the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) (which,\n      in turn, can control the SSI), or the Tracking Subsystem.\n      The LMC also maintains an operator log which includes\n      operator directives and subsystem responses.  One important\n      Radio Science specific function that the LMC performs is\n      receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal\n      level data from the PPM for display at the LMC console and\n      for inclusion in Monitor blocks.  These blocks are recorded\n      on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the Mission Control\n      and Computing Center (MCCC) displays.  The LMC is required to\n      operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio\n      Science data acquisition period.\n \n      The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital\n      Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication\n      between the stations and JPL.  The ARA receives all required\n      data and status messages from the LMC/CMC and can record them\n      to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The\n      ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL and passes\n      them on to the CMC.\n \n \n    DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem\n    ---------------------------------\n      Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from\n      the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m STD antenna subnets.  The\n      antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors\n      which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio\n      frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large\n      collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy\n      onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and\n      angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for\n      gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between\n      zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as 5\n      cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling of\n      energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector and\n      then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas have\n      'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms that\n      are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows more\n      uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The 34-m\n      STD primary reflectors are classical paraboloids, while the\n      subreflectors are standard hyperboloids.\n \n      On the 70-m and 34-m STD antennas, the subreflector directs\n      received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a\n      device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn\n      and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In\n      the 34-m HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which\n      accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.\n      RF energy to be transmitted into space by the horns is\n      focused by the reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams,\n      pointed with high precision (either to the dichroic plate or\n      directly to the subreflector) by a series of drive motors and\n      gear trains that can rotate the movable components and their\n      support structures.\n \n      The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two\n      pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are\n      CONSCAN and 'blind pointing.' With CONSCAN enabled and a\n      closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the\n      system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around\n      its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are\n      computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied\n      by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly\n      (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the\n      Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern\n      to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the\n      receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal\n      level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan\n      position with the received signal level variations allows the\n      APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.\n      Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control\n      system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent\n      direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional\n      function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and\n      residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and\n      predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly\n      (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL\n      via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna\n      status monitoring.\n \n      During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low\n      received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an\n      occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under\n      these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and\n      pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined\n      Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.\n \n      Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least\n      the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received\n      Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain\n      experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may\n      be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on\n      elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal\n      degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs\n      (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)\n      which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC\n      passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to\n      the desired position.  Unlike the 70-m and 34-m HEFs which\n      have azimuth-elevation (AZ-EL) drives, the 34-m STD antennas\n      use (hour angle-declination) HA-DEC drives.  The same\n      positioning of the subreflector on the 34-m STD does not\n      create the same effect as on the 70-m and 34-m HEFs.\n \n      Pointing angles for all three antenna types are computed by\n      the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by\n      the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived\n      by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the\n      APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts\n      into AZ-EL coordinates for the 70-m and 34-m HEFs or into\n      HA-DEC coordinates for the 34-m STD antennas.  The LMC\n      operator then downloads the antenna AZ-EL or HA-DEC predict\n      points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer along with a\n      selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts consist of\n      time-tagged AZ-EL or HA-DEC points at selected time intervals\n      along with polynomial coefficients for interpolation between\n      points.\n \n      The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,\n      corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and\n      subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error\n      correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS\n      then sends angular position commands for each axis at the\n      rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate\n      commands are generated from the position commands at the\n      servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the\n      antenna.  In the 34-m STD antennas motors, rather than\n      servos, are used to steer the antenna; there is no feedback\n      once the 34-m STD has been told where to point.\n \n      When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for\n      spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using\n      'planetary mode' -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension\n      (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly\n      with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to\n      the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS\n      quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points\n      which are on one-day centers.\n \n      A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for\n      tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial\n      frame.\n \n      Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna\n      has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called\n      'precision' mode.  A pointing control loop derives the main\n      AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two- axis\n      autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference\n      Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a\n      precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive\n      system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main\n      antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft\n      encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-\n      elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by\n      measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light\n      beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by\n      moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.\n      Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are\n      possible in 'precision' mode.  The 'precision' mode is not\n      available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their\n      beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.\n \n \n    DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem\n    --------------------------------\n      70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones\n      installed in a structure at the center of the main reflector.\n      The feeds are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.\n      Selection of the feed is made by rotation of the\n      subreflector.  A dichroic mirror assembly, half on the S-band\n      cone and half on the X-band cone, permits simultaneous use of\n      the S- and X-band frequencies.  The third cone is devoted to\n      R&D and more specialized work.\n \n      The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-\n      and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them\n      through polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The\n      polarizer plates are adjusted so that the signals are\n      directed to a pair of redundant amplifiers for each\n      frequency, thus allowing simultaneous reception of signals in\n      two orthogonal polarizations.  For S-band these are two Block\n      IVA S-band Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the\n      amplifiers are Block IIA TWMs.\n \n      34-m STD Antennas: These antennas have two feed horns, one\n      for S-band signals and one for X-band.  The horns are mounted\n      on a cone which is fixed in relation to the subreflector.  A\n      dichroic plate mounted above the horns directs energy from\n      the subreflector into the proper horn.\n \n      The AMS directs the received S- and X-band signals through\n      polarizer plates and on to amplification.  There are two\n      Block III S-band TWMs and two Block I X-band TWMs.\n \n      34-m HEF Antennas: Unlike the other antennas, the 34-m HEF\n      uses a single feed for both S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S-\n      and X-band receive as well as X-band transmit is possible\n      thanks to the presence of an S/X 'combiner' which acts as a\n      diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP is user selected through a\n      switch so neither a polarizer nor an orthomode transducer is\n      needed.  X-band amplification options include two Block II\n      TWMs or an HEMT Low Noise Amplifier (LNA).  S-band\n      amplification is provided by an FET LNA.\n \n \n    DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem\n    -------------------------------\n      The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of three groups of\n      equipment: the closed-loop receiver group, the open-loop\n      receiver group, and the RF monitor group.  This subsystem is\n      controlled by the Receiver-Exciter Controller (REC) which\n      communicates directly with the DMC for predicts and OCI\n      reception and status reporting.\n \n      The exciter generates the S-band signal (or X-band for the\n      34-m HEF only) which is provided to the Transmitter Subsystem\n      for the spacecraft uplink signal.  It is tunable under\n      command of the Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO) which\n      receives predicts from the Metric Data Assembly (MDA).\n \n      The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and\n      the feed horn for all three antennas (used for simultaneous\n      transmission and reception) may be configured such that it is\n      out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass\n      mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the\n      receiver system.\n \n      Closed Loop Receivers: The Block IV receiver-exciter at the\n      70-m stations allows for two receiver channels, each capable\n      of L-Band (e.g., 1668 MHz frequency or 18 cm wavelength),\n      S-band, or X-band reception, and an S-band exciter for\n      generation of uplink signals through the low-power or\n      high-power transmitter.  The Block III receiver-exciter at\n      the 34-m STD stations allows for two receiver channels, each\n      capable of S-band or X-band reception and an exciter used to\n      generate an uplink signal through the low-power transmitter.\n      The receiver-exciter at the 34-m HEF stations allows for one\n      channel only.\n \n      The closed-loop receivers provide the capability for rapid\n      acquisition of a spacecraft signal and telemetry lockup.  In\n      order to accomplish acquisition within a short time, the\n      receivers are predict driven to search for, acquire, and\n      track the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition\n      precludes manual tuning though that remains as a backup\n      capability.  The subsystem utilizes FFT analyzers for rapid\n      acquisition.  The predicts are NSS generated, transmitted to\n      the CMC which sends them to the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem\n      where two sets can be stored.  The receiver starts\n      acquisition at uplink time plus one round-trip-light-time or\n      at operator specified times.  The receivers may also be\n      operated from the LMC without a local operator attending\n      them.  The receivers send performance and status data,\n      displays, and event messages to the LMC.\n \n      Either the exciter synthesizer signal or the simulation (SIM)\n      synthesizer signal is used as the reference for the Doppler\n      extractor in the closed-loop receiver systems, depending on\n      the spacecraft being tracked (and Project guidelines).  The\n      SIM synthesizer is not ramped; instead it uses one constant\n      frequency, the Track Synthesizer Frequency (TSF), which is an\n      average frequency for the entire pass.\n \n      The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of\n      three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It will be\n      configured such that the expected amplitude changes are\n      accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth\n      (2BLo) will be configured such that the expected phase\n      changes can be accommodated while maintaining the best\n      possible loop SNR.\n \n      Open-Loop Receivers: There are two types of Radio Science\n      Open-Loop Receivers (OLR) in use.  At 70-m and 34-m HEF\n      stations the OLR is a a dedicated four channel, narrow-band\n      receiver which provides amplified and downconverted video\n      band signals to the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP);\n      it sometimes goes by the designation 'RIV'.  At 34-m STD\n      stations (DSS 42 and DSS 61) the OLR is an older system, the\n      Multi-Mission Receiver (MMR), which provides two channels of\n      narrow-band receiver output.  Both OLR systems are described\n      in detail below under 'Electronics - DSN'; here the overview\n      continues only for the RIV system.\n \n      The 70-m and 34-m HEF OLR utilizes a fixed first Local\n      Oscillator (LO) frequency and a tunable second LO frequency\n      to minimize phase noise and improve frequency stability.  The\n      OLR consists of an RF-to-IF downconverter located in the\n      antenna, an IF selection switch (IVC), and a Radio Science\n      IF-VF downconverter (RIV) located in the SPC.  The RF-IF\n      downconverters in the 70-m antennas are equipped for four IF\n      channels: S-RCP, S-LCP, X-RCP, and X-LCP.  The 34-m HEF\n      stations are equipped with a two-channel RF-IF: S-band and\n      X-band.  The IVC switches the IF input between the 70-m and\n      34-m HEF antennas.\n \n      The RIV contains the tunable second LO, a set of video\n      bandpass filters, IF attenuators, and a controller (RIC).\n      The LO tuning is done via DSP control of the POCA/PLO\n      combination based on a predict set.  The POCA is a\n      Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly and the PLO is a\n      Programmable Local Oscillator (commonly called the DANA\n      synthesizer).  The bandpass filters are selectable via the\n      DSP.  The RIC provides an interface between the DSP and the\n      RIV.  It is controlled from the LMC via the DSP.  The RIC\n      selects the filter and attenuator settings and provides\n      monitor data to the DSP.  The RIC could also be manually\n      controlled from the front panel in case the electronic\n      interface to the DSP is lost.\n \n      RF Monitor -- SSI and PPM: The RF monitor group of the\n      Receiver-Exciter Subsystem provides spectral measurements\n      using the Spectral Signal Indicator (SSI) and measurements of\n      the received channel system temperature and spacecraft signal\n      level using the Precision Power Monitor (PPM).\n \n      The SSI provides a local display of the received signal\n      spectrum at a dedicated terminal at the DSCC and routes these\n      same data to the DSP which routes them to NOCC for remote\n      display at JPL for real-time monitoring and RIV/DSP\n      configuration verification.  These displays are used to\n      validate Radio Science Subsystem data at the DSS, NOCC, and\n      Mission Support Areas.  The SSI configuration is controlled\n      by the DSP and a duplicate of the SSI spectrum appears on the\n      LMC via the DSP.  During real-time operations the SSI data\n      also serve as a quick-look science data type for Radio\n      Science experiments.\n \n      The PPM measures system noise temperatures (SNT) using a\n      Noise Adding Radiometer (NAR) and downlink signal levels\n      using the Signal Level Estimator (SLE).  The PPM accepts its\n      input from the closed-loop receiver.  The SNT is measured by\n      injecting known amounts of noise power into the signal path\n      and comparing the total power with the noise injection 'on'\n      against the total power with the noise injection 'off.' That\n      operation is based on the fact that receiver noise power is\n      directly proportional to temperature; thus measuring the\n      relative increase in noise power due to the presence of a\n      calibrated thermal noise source allows direct calculation of\n      SNT.  Signal level is measured by calculating an FFT to\n      estimate the SNR between the signal level and the receiver\n      noise floor where the power is known from the SNT\n      measurements.\n \n      There is one PPM controller at the SPC which is used to\n      control all SNT measurements.  The SNT integration time can\n      be selected to represent the time required for a measurement\n      of 30K to have a one-sigma uncertainty of 0.3K or 1%.\n \n \n    DSCC Transmitter Subsystem\n    --------------------------\n      The Transmitter Subsystem accepts the S-band frequency\n      exciter signal from the Block III or Block IV Receiver-\n      Exciter Subsystem exciter and amplifies it to the required\n      transmit output level.  The amplified signal is routed via\n      the diplexer through the feed horn to the antenna and then\n      focused and beamed to the spacecraft.\n \n      The Transmitter Subsystem power capabilities range from 18 kw\n      to 400 kw.  Power levels above 18 kw are available only at\n      70-m stations.\n \n \n    DSCC Tracking Subsystem\n    -----------------------\n      The Tracking Subsystem primary functions are to acquire and\n      maintain communications with the spacecraft and to generate\n      and format radiometric data containing Doppler and range.\n \n      The DSCC Tracking Subsystem (DTK) receives the carrier\n      signals and ranging spectra from the Receiver-Exciter\n      Subsystem.  The Doppler cycle counts are counted, formatted,\n      and transmitted to JPL in real time.  Ranging data are also\n      transmitted to JPL in real time.  Also contained in these\n      blocks is the AGC information from the Receiver-Exciter\n      Subsystem.  The Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT)\n      at JPL produces an Archival Tracking Data File (ATDF) which\n      contains Doppler and ranging data.\n \n      In addition, the Tracking Subsystem receives from the CMC\n      frequency predicts (used to compute frequency residuals and\n      noise estimates), receiver tuning predicts (used to tune the\n      closed-loop receivers), and uplink tuning predicts (used to\n      tune the exciter).  From the LMC, it receives configuration\n      and control directives as well as configuration and status\n      information on the transmitter, microwave, and frequency and\n      timing subsystems.\n \n      The Metric Data Assembly (MDA) controls all of the DTK\n      functions supporting the uplink and downlink activities.  The\n      MDA receives uplink predicts and controls the uplink tuning\n      by commanding the DCO.  The MDA also controls the Sequential\n      Ranging Assembly (SRA).  It formats the Doppler and range\n      measurements and provides them to the GCF for transmission to\n      NOCC.\n \n      The Sequential Ranging Assembly (SRA) measures the round trip\n      light time (RTLT) of a radio signal traveling from a ground\n      tracking station to a spacecraft and back.  From the RTLT,\n      phase, and Doppler data, the spacecraft range can be\n      determined.  A coded signal is modulated on an uplink carrier\n      and transmitted to the spacecraft where it is detected and\n      transponded back to the ground station.  As a result, the\n      signal received at the tracking station is delayed by its\n      round trip through space and shifted in frequency by the\n      Doppler effect due to the relative motion between the\n      spacecraft and the tracking station on Earth.\n \n \n    DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)\n    ----------------------------------------\n      The DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) located at the\n      SPC digitizes and records the narrowband output data from the\n      RIV.  It consists of a Narrow Band Occultation Converter\n      (NBOC) containing four Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), a\n      ModComp CLASSIC computer processor called the Spectrum\n      Processing Assembly (SPA), and several magnetic tape drives.\n      Magnetic tapes containing DSP output are known as Original\n      Data Records (ODRs).  Electronic near real-time data\n      transmission (known as an Original Data Stream, or ODS) may\n      be possible in certain circumstances.\n \n      The DSP is operated through the LMC.  Using the\n      SPA-Radioscience (SPA-R) software, the DSP allows for\n      real-time frequency and time offsets (while in RUN mode) and,\n      if necessary, snap tuning between the two frequency ranges\n      transmitted by the spacecraft: coherent and non-coherent.\n      The DSP receives Radio Science frequency predicts from the\n      CMC, allows for multiple predict set archiving (up to 60\n      sets) at the SPA, and allows for manual predict generation\n      and editing.  It accepts configuration and control data from\n      the LMC, provides display data to the LMC, and transmits the\n      signal spectra from the SSI as well as status information to\n      NOCC and the Project Mission Support Area (MSA) via the GCF\n      data lines.  The DSP records the digitized narrowband samples\n      and the supporting header information (i.e., time tags, POCA\n      frequencies, etc.) on 9-track magnetic tapes in 6250 or 1600\n      bpi GCR format.\n \n      Through the DSP-RIC interface the DSP controls the RIV filter\n      selection and attenuation levels.  It also receives RIV\n      performance monitoring via the RIC.  In case of failure of\n      the DSP-RIC interface, the RIV can be controlled manually\n      from the front panel.\n \n      All the RIV and DSP control parameters and configuration\n      directives are stored in the SPA in a macro-like file called\n      an 'experiment directive' table.  A number of default\n      directives exist in the DSP for the major Radio Science\n      experiments.  Operators can create their own table entries.\n \n      Items such as verification of the configuration of the prime\n      open-loop recording subsystem, the selection of the required\n      predict sets, and proper system performance prior to the\n      recording periods will be checked in real-time at JPL via the\n      NOCC displays using primarily the remote SSI display at NOCC\n      and the NRV displays.  Because of this, transmission of the\n      DSP/SSI monitor information is enabled prior to the start of\n      recording.  The specific run time and tape recording times\n      will be identified in the Sequence of Events (SOE) and/or DSN\n      Keyword File.\n \n      The DSP can be used to duplicate ODRs.  It also has the\n      capability to play back a certain section of the recorded\n      data after conclusion of the recording periods.\n \n \n    DSCC Frequency and Timing Subsystem\n    -----------------------------------\n      The Frequency and Timing Subsystem (FTS) provides all\n      frequency and timing references required by the other DSCC\n      subsystems.  It contains four frequency standards of which\n      one is prime and the other three are backups.  Selection of\n      the prime standard is done via the CMC.  Of these four\n      standards, two are hydrogen masers followed by clean-up loops\n      (CUL) and two are cesium standards.  These four standards all\n      feed the Coherent Reference Generator (CRG) which provides\n      the frequency references used by the rest of the complex.  It\n      also provides the frequency reference to the Master Clock\n      Assembly (MCA) which in turn provides time to the Time\n      Insertion and Distribution Assembly (TID) which provides UTC\n      and SIM-time to the complex.\n \n      JPL's ability to monitor the FTS at each DSCC is limited to\n      the MDA calculated Doppler pseudo-residuals, the Doppler\n      noise, the SSI, and to a system which uses the Global\n      Positioning System (GPS).  GPS receivers at each DSCC receive\n      a one-pulse-per-second pulse from the station's (hydrogen\n      maser referenced) FTS and a pulse from a GPS satellite at\n      scheduled times.  After compensating for the satellite signal\n      delay, the timing offset is reported to JPL where a database\n      is kept.  The clock offsets stored in the JPL database are\n      given in microseconds; each entry is a mean reading of\n      measurements from several GPS satellites and a time tag\n      associated with the mean reading.

These are\n    summarized in the following set of tables.  Note that 64-m\n    antennas were upgraded to 70-m between 1986 and 1989.\n    Beamwidth is half-power full angular width.  Polarization is\n    circular; L denotes left circular polarization (LCP), and R\n    denotes right circular polarization (RCP).\n \n                           DSS S-Band Characteristics\n \n                               64-m      70-m     34-m     34-m\n           Transmit                                STD      HEF\n           --------           -----     -----    -----    -----\n           Frequency (MHz)    2110-     2110-    2025-     N/A\n                               2120      2120     2120\n           Wavelength (m)     0.142     0.142    0.142     N/A\n           Ant Gain (dBi)                62.7     55.2     N/A\n           Beamwidth (deg)              0.119     0.31     N/A\n           Polarization                L or R   L or R     N/A\n           Tx Power (kW)               20-400       20     N/A\n \n           Receive\n           -------\n           Frequency (MHz)    2270-     2270-    2270-    2200-\n                               2300      2300     2300     2300\n           Wavelength (m)     0.131     0.131    0.131    0.131\n           Ant Gain (dBi)      61.6      63.3     56.2     56.0\n           Beamwidth (deg)              0.108     0.27     0.24\n           Polarization       L & R     L & R   L or R   L or R\n           System Temp (K)       22        20       22       38\n \n                           DSS X-Band Characteristics\n \n                               64-m      70-m     34-m     34-m\n           Transmit                                STD      HEF\n           --------           -----     -----    -----    -----\n           Frequency (MHz)     8495      8495     N/A     7145-\n                                                           7190\n           Wavelength (m)     0.035     0.035     N/A     0.042\n           Ant Gain (dBi)                74.2     N/A        67\n           Beamwidth (deg)                        N/A     0.074\n           Polarization      L or R    L or R     N/A    L or R\n           Tx Power (kW)        360       360     N/A        20\n \n           Receive\n           -------\n           Frequency (MHz)    8400-     8400-    8400-    8400-\n                               8500      8500     8500     8500\n           Wavelength (m)     0.036     0.036    0.036    0.036\n           Ant Gain (dBi)      71.7      74.2     66.2     68.3\n           Beamwidth (deg)              0.031    0.075    0.063\n           Polarization       L & R     L & R    L & R    L & R\n           System Temp (K)       27        20       25       20\n \n           NB: X-band 64-m and 70-m transmitting parameters are given\n               at 8495 MHz, the frequency used by the Goldstone\n               planetary radar system.

These signals in turn are down converted and\n      passed through additional filters until they yield Output\n      with bandwidths up to 45 kHz.

No information on specific calibration\n    activities is available.  Nominal performance specifications\n    are shown in the tables above.  Additional information may be\n    available in [DSN810-5].\n \n    Prior to each tracking pass, station operators perform a series\n    of calibrations to ensure that systems meet specifications for\n    that operational period.  Included in these calibrations is\n    measurement of receiver system temperature in the configuration\n    to be employed during the pass.  Results of these calibrations\n    are recorded in (hard copy) Controller's Logs for each pass.\n \n    The nominal procedure for initializing open-loop receiver\n    attenuator settings is described below.  In cases where widely\n    varying signal levels are expected, the procedure may be\n    modified in advance or real-time adjustments may be made to\n    attenuator settings.\n \n \n    Open-Loop Receiver Attenuation Calibration\n    ------------------------------------------\n      The open-loop receiver attenuator calibrations are performed\n      to establish the output of the open-loop receivers at a level\n      that will not saturate the analog-to-digital converters.  To\n      achieve this, the calibration is done using a test signal\n      generated by the exciter/translator that is set to the peak\n      predicted signal level for the upcoming pass.  Then the\n      output level of the receiver's video band spectrum envelope\n      is adjusted to the level determined by equation (3) below (to\n      five-sigma).  Note that the SNR in the equation (2) is in dB\n      while the SNR in equation (3) is linear.\n \n           Pn = -198.6 + 10*log(SNT) + 10*log(1.2*Fbw)              (1)\n \n           SNR = Ps - Pn                               (SNR in dB)  (2)\n \n           Vrms = sqrt(SNR + 1)/[1 + 0.283*sqrt(SNR)]  (SNR linear) (3)\n \n           where    Fbw = receiver filter bandwidth (Hz)\n                    Pn  = receiver noise power (dBm)\n                    Ps  = signal power (dBm)\n                    SNT = system noise temperature (K)\n                    SNR = predicted signal-to-noise ratio\n \n \n  Operational Considerations - DSN\n  ================================\n    The DSN is a complex and dynamic 'instrument.' Its performance\n    for Radio Science depends on a number of factors from equipment\n    configuration to meteorological conditions.  No specific\n    information on 'operational considerations' can be given here.\n \n \n  Operational Modes - DSN\n  =======================\n \n    DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem\n    ---------------------------------\n      Pointing of DSCC antennas may be carried out in several ways.\n      For details see the subsection 'DSCC Antenna Mechanical\n      Subsystem' in the 'Subsystem' section.  Binary pointing is\n      the preferred mode for tracking spacecraft; pointing predicts\n      are provided, and the antenna simply follows those.  With\n      CONSCAN, the antenna scans conically about the optimum\n      pointing direction, using closed-loop receiver signal\n      strength estimates as feedback.  In planetary mode, the\n      system interpolates from three (slowly changing) RA-DEC\n      target coordinates; this is 'blind' pointing since there is\n      no feedback from a detected signal.  In sidereal mode, the\n      antenna tracks a fixed point on the celestial sphere.  In\n      'precision' mode, the antenna pointing is adjusted using an\n      optical feedback system.  It is possible on most antennas to\n      freeze z-axis motion of the subreflector to minimize phase\n      changes in the received signal.\n \n \n    DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem\n    -------------------------------\n      The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and\n      the feed horns on all three antennas may be configured so\n      that it is out of the received signal path in order to\n      improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver system.\n      This is known as the 'listen-only' or 'bypass' mode.\n \n \n    Closed-Loop vs. Open-Loop Reception\n    -----------------------------------\n      Radio Science data can be collected in two modes: closed-\n      loop, in which a phase-locked loop receiver tracks the\n      spacecraft signal, or open-loop, in which a receiver samples\n      and records a band within which the desired signal presumably\n      resides.  Closed-loop data are collected using Closed-Loop\n      Receivers, and open-loop data are collected using Open-Loop\n      Receivers in conjunction with the DSCC Spectrum Processing\n      Subsystem (DSP).  See the Subsystems section for further\n      information.\n \n \n    Closed-Loop Receiver AGC Loop\n    -----------------------------\n      The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of\n      three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  Ordinarily it is\n      configured so that expected signal amplitude changes are\n      accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth is\n      ordinarily configured so that expected phase changes can be\n      accommodated while maintaining the best possible loop SNR.\n \n \n    Coherent vs. Non-Coherent Operation\n    -----------------------------------\n      The frequency of the signal transmitted from the spacecraft\n      can generally be controlled in two ways -- by locking to a\n      signal received from a ground station or by locking to an\n      on-board oscillator.  These are known as the coherent (or\n      'two-way') and non-coherent ('one-way') modes, respectively.\n      Mode selection is made at the spacecraft, based on commands\n      received from the ground.  When operating in the coherent\n      mode, the transponder carrier frequency is derived from the\n      received uplink carrier frequency with a 'turn-around ratio'\n      typically of 240/221.  In the non-coherent mode, the downlink\n      carrier frequency is derived from the spacecraft on-board\n      crystal-controlled oscillator.  Either closed-loop or\n      open-loop receivers (or both) can be used with either\n      spacecraft frequency reference mode.  Closed-loop reception\n      in two-way mode is usually preferred for routine tracking.\n      Occasionally the spacecraft operates coherently while two\n      ground stations receive the 'downlink' signal; this is\n      sometimes known as the 'three-way' mode.\n \n \n    DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)\n    ----------------------------------------\n      The DSP can operate in four sampling modes with from 1 to 4\n      input signals.  Input channels are assigned to ADC inputs\n      during DSP configuration.  Modes and sampling rates are\n      summarized in the tables below:\n \n        Mode   Analog-to-Digital Operation\n        ----   ----------------------------\n          1    4 signals, each sampled by a single ADC\n          2    1 signal, sampled sequentially by 4 ADCs\n          3    2 signals, each sampled sequentially by 2 ADCs\n          4    2 signals, the first sampled by ADC #1 and the second\n                           sampled sequentially at 3 times the rate\n                            by ADCs #2-4\n \n             8-bit Samples               12-bit  Samples\n            Sampling  Rates              Sampling  Rates\n         (samples/sec per ADC)        (samples/sec per ADC)\n         ---------------------        ---------------------\n                 50000\n                 31250\n                 25000\n                 15625\n                 12500\n                 10000                        10000\n                  6250\n                  5000                         5000\n                  4000\n                  3125\n                  2500\n                                               2000\n                  1250\n                  1000                         1000\n                   500\n                   400\n                   250\n                   200                          200\n \n        Input to each ADC is identified in header records by a Signal\n        Channel Number (J1 - J4).

Raw\n      samples comprise the data block in each DSP record; a header\n      record (presently 83 16-bit words) contains ancillary\n      information such as:\n \n      time tag for the first sample in the data block RMS values of\n      receiver signal levels and ADC outputs POCA frequency and\n      drift rate\n \n \n    Closed-Loop System\n    ------------------\n      Closed-loop data are recorded in Archival Tracking Data Files\n      (ATDFs), as well as certain secondary products such as the\n      Orbit Data File (ODF).

The Goodrich unit consists of a\n  camera module and a lens. The camera's focal plane InGaAs sensor has\n  a 320 [H] x 240 [V] pixel format.\n \n  NIR1 is one of two near infrared cameras in the LCROSS payload. The\n  cameras are identical except that NIR1 contains a long-pass filter\n  (> 1.4 microns). NIR2 contains no filter.\n \n  The 25mm, f/1.4 C-mount glass lens from UkaOptics (Model Number #2514M)\n  provides a 28.7 deg [H] x 21.7 deg [V] (36.0 deg [Diagonal]) field-of-view.\n  The NIR1 filter is Spectragon catalog filter LP-1400nm (25.4mm diameter x\n  1.0mm thick).\n \n  NIR1 camera's focal plane InGaAs sensor is sensitive from 0.9 to\n  1.7 microns. The addition of the Spectragon filter in NIR1 provides\n  an effective 1.4-1.7 micron response for the unit.\n \n  Although the camera's native format is 320 [H] x 240 [V] 12-bit images,\n  the images are converted by the camera to an analog NTSC\n  signal before transfer to the DHU where they are captured at 720 [H] x\n  486 [V], the same resolution as the VIS camera.\n \n  Also, like the VIS camera, the NIR images are captured in 24-bit per pixel\n  RGB. Because the NIR cameras provide grayscale images, the three\n  RGB channels are identical except for noise introduced in the\n  conversion to and from NTSC.  These images are compressed in the\n  DHU using a lossy compression algorithm performed by the Analog\n  Devices 611 Video Codec set on 80% quality and decompressed on the\n  ground.\n \n  The near-infrared cameras contain no cryogenic liquids or moving\n  parts.  Each contains an internal thermo-electric cooler which can\n  actively cool InGaAs sensor, but the default setting is near room\n  temperature (~20 C).  Each camera's peak power during operation is\n  1.6 W.  Both gain and exposure time are configurable with commands\n  sent to the camera, and different gains and exposures are used at\n  different times during the LCROSS mission.\n \n  Scientific Objectives\n  =====================\n \n  The main science objective for the near infrared cameras (NIR1 & NIR2)\n  is to provide near infrared contextual imagery of the ejecta cloud\n  morphology. When used together as a pair, NIR1 (filter) provides a scene\n  image integrated between 1.4 and 1.7 microns, whereas NIR2 (no filter)\n  provides a scene image integrated over 0.9 to 1.7 microns. When utilizing\n  the cameras as a pair, the difference in the overall camera efficiency\n  (electrons out/photons in) due to the presence of an effective 80%\n  transmissive long-pass filter (lambda > 1.4 microns) in NIR1 needs to be\n  taken into account. The water band at 1.5 microns, if present in the ejecta,\n  will be visible in both cameras.\n \n  The filtered NIR1 is also used to image the impact flash event in the\n  near-infrared (1.4 - 1.7 microns).\n \n  The unfiltered NIR2 is used for a star field calibration and the final\n  minutes of the mission, taking advantage of its larger spectral range and\n  greater sensitivity.\n \n  Calibration\n  ===========\n \n  The image files were initially processed by the LCROSS GSEOS (Ground\n  Support Equipment Operating System) which extracted the image\n  files from telemetry, performed decompression, and converted them to a\n  24-bit RGB format with MET-based packet timestamp encoded in the filename.\n  The near infrared cameras are only capable of generating grayscale images.\n  The RGB values are typically within +/- 2 DN of each other, this difference\n  due to noise introduced in the conversion to and from NTSC. Therefore, the\n  images were further processed with the LCROSS Make Archive Program to\n  extract the correct grayscale image and generate the binary image and\n  ASCII label (.lbl) files, time stamping each pair with the S/C UTC time\n  at time of data collection.\n \n  The flight near-infrared cameras were not directly radiometrically\n  calibrated pre-flight. A flight spare camera, both with (to mimic NIR1)\n  and without (to mimic NIR2) an internal spare flight NIR1 filter was\n  calibrated using a NIST-calibrated reference source. The calibration steps\n  and validation of this approach, using flight data, along with the\n  assumptions and caveats, are described in the LCROSS Instrument Response\n  and Calibration Report in the CALIB directory of this archive.\n \n \n  Operational Modes\n  =================\n \n  The LCROSS near-infrared cameras have numerous parameters and mode\n  settings, but LCROSS uses these cameras in limited ways. For all images,\n  digital gain is set to 1. Throughout the mission there are four main\n  modes used for these cameras:\n \n  (1) Fixed Short Exposure time (OPR 5 & 7/ENH:ENABLE OFF/AGC:ENABLE OFF)\n  (2) Fixed Long Exposure time (OPR 15/ENH:ENABLE OFF/AGC:ENABLE OFF)\n  (3) Automatic Gain Control Enabled (ENH:ENABLE OFF/AGC:ENABLE ON)\n  (4) Image Enhancement Enabled (Fixed OPR/ENH:ENABLE ON/AGC:ENABLE OFF)\n \n  The mode settings are documented with each image.\n \n  (1) OPR 5 & 7 have an effective integration time of 0.61 ms and 1.16 ms\n      per image with a factory-derived optimized pixel gain. This setting\n      was designed to place a integrated scene input of ~10^9 photons/s/pixel\n      detected by the camera within the camera's effective analog 8-bit range.\n      OPR 5 & OPR 7 are the adopted curtain mode setting for NIR2 & NIR1,\n      respectively, based on the expected radiance values for the lunar\n      south pole on October 9, 2009.\n      Other OPR settings were used during calibration targets (Earth and Moon\n      from 300,000-800,000km distances). See the LCROSS Instrument Response\n      and Calibration Report for details of the exposure time and gain\n      parameters for these OPR settings.\n  (2) OPR 15 has an effective integration time of 16.24 ms per image with\n      a factor-derived optimized pixel gain. This setting was designed to\n      place an integrated (dim) scene input of less than 10^7 photons/s/pixel\n      detected by the camera within the camera's effective analog 8-bit range.\n      This setting is used for starfield and crater observations.\n      OPR 10, used only in NIR2 for some final images in the impact\n      sequence, has an effective integration time of 3.08 ms per image.\n  (3) Automatic Gain Control enabled will adjust the operational\n      configuration (OPR number) to achieve the best camera sensitivity\n      settings for the given imaging scene.  The range of available OPRs\n      provide integration times 0.11ms (OPR 0) and (16.24 ms). This setting\n      was designed to allow for the cameras to optimize the integration time\n      to place the scene within the middle range of the effective 8-bit range,\n      particularly when the scene's brightness is unknown.\n  (4) Image Enhancement enabled linearly stretches the image over\n      the available pixel depth to result in a higher contrast scene for\n      display. This setting was designed to provide additional information to\n      pick out a potentially dim signal against an unknown background\n      (e.g., starfield and flash). It is used typically with the long\n      exposure setting and in addition to one of the other modes above.","tools":[]},{"tags":["Imager"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:nir2.lcross","display_name":"Near Infrared Camera 2","display_description":"Instrument Overview\n  ===================\n \n  The LCROSS near infrared camera #2 (NIR2) is a ruggedized Goodrich\n  Sensors Unlimited SU320-KTX camera.

NIR2 contains no filter.\n \n  The 25mm, f/1.4 C-mount glass lens from UkaOptics (Model Number #2514M)\n  provides a 28.7 deg [H] x 21.7 deg [V] (36.0 deg [Diagonal]) field-of-view.\n \n  NIR2 camera's focal plane InGaAs sensor is sensitive from 0.9 to\n  1.7 microns.\n \n  Although the camera's native format is 320 [H] x 240 [V] 12-bit images,\n  the images are converted by the camera to an analog NTSC\n  signal before transfer to the DHU where they are captured at 720 [H] x\n  486 [V], the same resolution as the VIS camera.\n \n  Also, like the VIS camera, the NIR images are captured in 24-bit per pixel\n  RGB. Because the NIR cameras provide grayscale images, the three\n  RGB channels are identical except for noise introduced in the\n  conversion to and from NTSC.  These images are compressed in the\n  DHU using a lossy compression algorithm performed by the Analog\n  Devices 611 Video Codec set on 80% quality and decompressed on the\n  ground.\n \n  The near-infrared cameras contain no cryogenic liquids or moving\n  parts.  Each contains an internal thermo-electric cooler which can\n  actively cool InGaAs sensor, but the default setting is near room\n  temperature (~20 C).  Each camera's peak power during operation is\n  1.6 W.  Both gain and exposure time are configurable with commands\n  sent to the camera, and different gains and exposures are used at\n  different times during the LCROSS mission.\n \n \n  Scientific Objectives\n  =====================\n \n  The main science objective for the near infrared cameras (NIR1 & NIR2)\n  is to provide near infrared contextual imagery of the ejecta cloud\n  morphology. When used together as a pair, NIR1 (filter) provides a scene\n  image integrated between 1.4 and 1.7 microns, whereas NIR2 (no filter)\n  provides a scene image integrated over 0.9 to 1.7 microns. When utilizing\n  the cameras as a pair, the difference in the overall camera efficiency\n  (electrons out/photons in) due to the presence of an effective 80%\n  transmissive long-pass filter (lambda > 1.4 microns) in NIR1 needs to be\n  taken into account. The water band at 1.5 microns, if present in the ejecta,\n  will be visible in both cameras.\n \n  The filtered NIR1 is also used to image the impact flash event in the\n  near-infrared (1.4 - 1.7 microns).\n \n  The unfiltered NIR2 is used for a star field calibration and the final\n  minutes of the mission, taking advantage of its larger spectral range and\n  greater sensitivity.\n \n  Calibration\n  ===========\n \n  The image files were initially processed by the LCROSS GSEOS (Ground\n  Support Equipment Operating System) which extracted the image\n  files from telemetry, performed decompression, and converted them to a\n  24-bit RGB format with MET-based packet timestamp encoded in the filename.\n  The near infrared cameras are only capable of generating grayscale images.\n  The RGB values are typically within +/- 2 DN of each other, this difference\n  due to noise introduced in the conversion to and from NTSC. Therefore, the\n  images were further processed with the LCROSS Make Archive Program to\n  extract the correct grayscale image and generate the binary image and\n  ASCII label (.lbl) files, time stamping each pair with the S/C UTC time\n  at time of data collection.\n \n  The flight near-infrared cameras were not directly radiometrically\n  calibrated pre-flight. A flight spare camera, both with (to mimic NIR1)\n  and without (to mimic NIR2) an internal spare flight NIR1 filter was\n  calibrated using a NIST-calibrated reference source. The calibration steps\n  and validation of this approach, using flight data, along with the\n  assumptions and caveats, are described in the LCROSS Instrument Response\n  and Calibration Report.\n \n  Operational Modes\n  =================\n \n  The LCROSS near-infrared cameras have numerous parameters and mode\n  settings, but LCROSS uses these cameras in limited ways. For all images,\n  digital gain is set to 1. Throughout the mission there are four main\n  modes used for these cameras:\n \n  (1) Fixed Short Exposure time (OPR 6/ENH:ENABLE OFF/AGC:ENABLE OFF)\n  (2) Fixed Long Exposure time (OPR 15/ENH:ENABLE OFF/AGC:ENABLE OFF)\n  (3) Automatic Gain Control Enabled (ENH:ENABLE OFF/AGC:ENABLE ON)\n  (4) Image Enhancement Enabled (Fixed OPR/ENH:ENABLE ON/AGC:ENABLE OFF)\n \n  The mode settings are documented with each image.\n \n  (1) OPR 5 & 7 have an effective integration time of 0.61 ms and 1.16 ms\n      per image with a factory-derived optimized pixel gain. This setting\n      was designed to place a integrated scene input of ~10^9 photons/s/pixel\n      detected by the camera within the camera's effective analog 8-bit range.\n      OPR 5 & OPR 7 are the adopted curtain mode setting for NIR2 & NIR1,\n      respectively, based on the expected radiance values for the lunar\n      south pole on October 9, 2009.\n      Other OPR settings were used during calibration targets (Earth and Moon\n      from 300,000-800,000km distances). See the LCROSS Instrument Response\n      and Calibration Report for details of the exposure time and gain\n      parameters for these OPR settings.\n  (2) OPR 15 has an effective integration time of 16.24 ms per image with\n      a factor-derived optimized pixel gain. This setting was designed to\n      place an integrated (dim) scene input of less than 10^7 photons/s/pixel\n      detected by the camera within the camera's effective analog 8-bit range.\n      This setting is used for starfield and crater observations.\n      OPR 10, used only in NIR2 for some final images in the impact\n      sequence, has an effective integration time of 3.08 ms per image.\n  (3) Automatic Gain Control enabled will adjust the operational\n      configuration (OPR number) to achieve the best camera sensitivity\n      settings for the given imaging scene.  The range of available OPRs\n      provide integration times 0.11ms (OPR 0) and (16.24 ms). This setting\n      was designed to allow for the cameras to optimize the integration time\n      to place the scene within the middle range of the effective 8-bit range,\n      particularly when the scene's brightness is unknown.\n  (4) Image Enhancement enabled linearly stretches the image over\n      the available pixel depth to result in a higher contrast scene for\n      display. This setting was designed to provide additional information to\n      pick out a potentially dim signal against an unknown background\n      (e.g., starfield and flash). It is used typically with the long\n      exposure setting and in addition to one of the other modes above.","tools":[]},{"tags":["Spectrometer"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:nsp1.lcross","display_name":"Near Infrared Spectrometer 1","display_description":"Instrument Overview\n  ===================\n \n  The LCROSS payload contains two near-infrared\n  spectrometers (NSP1/NSP2).

The modulated signal from each detector was fed directly\n        to its preamp, which contained the detector bias circuit.\n        The preamp input stage was an FET designed to provide high\n        gain and low noise.  The amplifiers were operated with both\n        ac and dc feedback so that the gain and bandwidth would be\n        relatively insensitive to internal component changes.\n        Following the preamp were a synchronous filter, demodulator,\n        log converter, output amplifier, science data multiplexer,\n        and data analog to pulse width converter.

The polystyrene spectrum\n        was superimposed on the target (Mars) spectrum each 12th\n        time.  Unfortunately, these spectra are unavailable at the\n        present time in digital form.  The spikes that occur in all\n        the spectra are introduced by allowing broadband radiation\n        onto the detector at certain rotational positions of the\n        circular variable filters.  These spikes represent wavelength\n        fiduciaries.  Thus, for Mariner 6, the spikes mark nominally\n        1.88 and 3.72 micrometers for the shortwave part of channel\n        2, and 3.04 and 6.14 micrometers on the longwave side.  It\n        will be found that the spikes do not relate reproducibly to\n        the locations of atmospheric CO2 features; there is a small\n        jitter in the relative locations.  Wavelength information can\n        also be derived from the known positions of these CO2\n        atmospheric features in the Mars data; this is probably the\n        most accurate and dependable scheme.  The supplier has\n        generated coefficients that describe a linear fit to the\n        wavelength scale, based on atmospheric features and the\n        spikes.  These appear in the headers for each spectrum.  Note\n        that the quality of the coefficients is variable and depends\n        on the noise level and the method chosen for that spectrum.\n \n        Refer to the instrument paper in Applied Optics for figures\n        showing the wavelength variation of filter transmission and\n        spectral resolution.\n \n \n    Instrument Optics 'IRS'\n    =======================\n      Telescope Diameter             : 0.248000\n      Telescope F Number             : 2.000000\n      Telescope Focal Length         : 0.498000\n      Telescope Resolution           : UNK\n      Telescope Serial Number        : UNK\n      Telescope T Number             : UNK\n      Telescope T Number Error       : UNK\n      Telescope Transmittance        : 0.877000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The IRS instrument is comprised of a 10-inch Dall-Kirkham\n        telescope feeding a pair of circular-variable filter\n        spectrometers.

The modulated signal from each detector was fed directly\n        to its preamp, which contained the detector bias circuit.\n        The preamp input stage was an FET designed to provide high\n        gain and low noise.

The time and frequency of each signal is referenced\n      to its respective Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO).  The Ka-band\n      and S-band signals are captured by the other spacecraft, and\n      precise measurements of signal properties are recorded for later\n      transmission to Earth.  The X-band link is received by stations\n      of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). Operations are continuous\n      and simultaneous on both spacecraft except that the X-Band\n      downlink to Earth is only used when a DSN station is available.\n \n      The sinusoidal Ka-band link is used to determine distance\n      (range) between the two spacecraft from the phase of the\n      received signal. The modulated S-band signal is for exchange of\n      Timing and Time Synchronization (TTS). The X-band link is a\n      one-way transmission to the DSN via the Radio Science Beacon\n      (RSB).\n \n      Except for mounting differences, LGRS-A and LGRS-B (on GRAIL-A\n      and GRAIL-B, respectively) are identical.  Each is responsible\n      for working with its twin to send and receive the signals needed\n      to accurately and precisely measure the changes in range between\n      the two orbiters. Each LGRS consists of an Ultra-Stable\n      Oscillator (USO), Microwave Assembly (MWA), a Time-Transfer\n      Assembly (TTA), and the Gravity Recovery Processor Assembly\n      (GPA).\n \n      The USO provides a steady reference signal that is used by all\n      of the instrument subsystems. Within the LGRS, the USO provides\n      the reference frequency for the MWA and the TTA. The MWA\n      converts the USO reference signal to the Ka-band frequency,\n      which is transmitted to the other orbiter.\n \n      The function of the TTA is to provide a two-way time-transfer\n      link between the spacecraft both to synchronize and to measure\n      the clock offset between the two LGRS clocks. The TTA generates\n      an S-band signal from the USO reference frequency and sends a\n      GPS-like ranging code to the other spacecraft. The GPA combines\n      all the inputs received from the MWA and TTA to produce the\n      radiometric data that are downlinked to the ground.\n \n      Finally, each Radio Science Beacon (RSB) transmits an X-Band\n      signal to the ground based on its USO; the drift of the USO is\n      derived from the one-way Doppler data.\n \n \n      Science Objectives\n      ==================\n      The inter-spacecraft radio links and the X-band radio link to\n      Earth are used to generate a high resolution gravitational field\n      of the Moon.\n \n \n      Operational Considerations - Spacecraft\n      =======================================\n      GRAIL Primary Mission (PM) & Extended Mission (XM) operational\n      considerations\n \n      The GRAIL PM started on March 01, 2012 and ended on May 29,\n      2012.  The GRAIL XM started on August 29, 2012, and ended on\n      December 12, 2012, followed by decommissioning from December 12,\n      2012, to December 18, 2012. Spacecraft events for these phases\n      (for example, propulsive maneuvers, Ka boresight calibration\n      attitude maneuvers, telecommunication configuration changes and\n      the science Lunar Gravity Ranging System (LGRS) events) are\n      described below including their impact on science processing.\n \n      1)Propulsive Maneuvers\n \n      During PM, there were propulsive maneuvers for GRAIL-B but not\n      for GRAIL-A.\n \n      During the XM, weekly Eccentricity Correction Maneuvers (ECM)\n      were needed on both GRAIL spacecraft to correct rapid orbit\n      eccentricity changes due to large gravity variations at low\n      altitudes. The ECMs were between 5 and 15 m/sec and required\n      near radial thrusting which meant that the science measurements\n      were interrupted for about 15 minutes while the spacecraft\n      executed the ECMs. In the day following the ECMs a cleanup Orbit\n      Trim Maneuver (OTM) maneuver was executed if needed. The OTMs in\n      general were at the cm/sec level and science measurements were\n      not interrupted during an OTM.\n \n      The mass change history for both spacecraft can be found in the\n      MAS1A/B Level-1 products, and the thruster on-times are\n      available in the THR1A/B level-1 products.

The angular momentum wheels apply torques on\n      the spacecraft by spinning up or down to maintain attitude. The\n      angular momentum wheels are only allowed to operate within a\n      specified wheel speed range. If the wheel speeds exceed the\n      specified range then attitude control thrusters (desaturation\n      maneuver) are used to apply a torque on the spacecraft to slow\n      or speed up the wheels, such that the resulting wheel speed is\n      within the specified range. In general the wheel speeds are\n      predictable, the desaturation maneuvers are planned in\n      advance, and the burns occur over the lunar poles. Since the\n      attitude control thrusters are not perfectly balanced, a\n      velocity is imparted on the spacecraft for every maneuver. The\n      velocity changes in general are small (< 5 mm/sec). LGRS\n      measurements are taken during the desaturation maneuvers but it\n      is recommended to break science data arcs at the desaturation\n      maneuver event times, since the velocity changes imparted on the\n      spacecraft are not known with sufficient accuracy for science\n      processing. A table for all desaturation events is shown below\n      for each spacecraft. The time reported in the table is the\n      average for all thruster activations associated with one\n      desaturation event. For detailed thruster on time histories see\n      level-1 product THR1A/B. The spacecraft mass change is very\n      small at the level of a few grams per event. For the December\n      2012 and June 2013 deliveries, the spacecraft mass change is not\n      accounted for in the MAS1A/B products, but it will be in future\n      higher version of the level-1 products.\n \n      PM GRAIL-A Angular momentum desaturation maneuvers\n \n      Time (TDB)             dV (mm/sec)\n      01-MAR-2012  16:16:08  3.07787\n      02-MAR-2012  15:16:38  1.12157\n      06-MAR-2012  22:10:18  7.48061\n      07-MAR-2012  21:45:38  1.96178\n      10-MAR-2012  14:05:48  5.43986\n      13-MAR-2012  15:54:24  6.27925\n      16-MAR-2012  23:23:18  6.86991\n      20-MAR-2012  10:39:03  7.05885\n      23-MAR-2012  21:55:20  6.94661\n      27-MAR-2012  19:51:24  5.96857\n      28-MAR-2012  02:13:10  0.48094\n      30-MAR-2012  07:12:28  3.96800\n      01-APR-2012  12:11:33  3.99191\n      03-APR-2012  13:23:08  3.72816\n      06-APR-2012  13:18:15  4.90296\n      12-APR-2012  07:27:47  7.49176\n      22-APR-2012  02:07:36  9.31918\n      24-APR-2012  07:06:16  2.09266\n      26-APR-2012  13:58:55  2.49039\n      28-APR-2012  22:44:55  2.75867\n      30-APR-2012  23:56:39  2.79112\n      03-MAY-2012  01:08:58  2.99911\n      05-MAY-2012  19:23:40  4.13733\n      08-MAY-2012  21:12:11  4.81434\n      11-MAY-2012  17:19:23  4.34395\n      14-MAY-2012  13:26:42  4.41361\n      17-MAY-2012  07:40:53  4.43868\n      19-MAY-2012  22:08:18  4.20894\n      22-MAY-2012  14:29:12  4.27568\n      25-MAY-2012  04:55:35  4.22526\n      27-MAY-2012  19:22:06  4.03179\n      29-MAY-2012  16:46:53  2.99687\n \n      XM GRAIL-A Angular momentum desaturation maneuvers\n \n      Time(TDB)             dV (mm/sec)\n      30-AUG-2012 16:17:08  3.27194\n      02-SEP-2012 01:58:51  4.00243\n      04-SEP-2012 11:06:17  4.26111\n      06-SEP-2012 12:51:12  3.66917\n      08-SEP-2012 14:36:08  3.74911\n      12-SEP-2012 23:36:37  4.35803\n      15-SEP-2012 08:43:02  4.53634\n      20-SEP-2012 01:07:07  4.35287\n      22-SEP-2012 10:14:06  4.45473\n      26-SEP-2012 19:14:49  4.35090\n      29-SEP-2012 04:20:58  4.17409\n      03-OCT-2012 22:35:43  3.80467\n      06-OCT-2012 07:42:52  3.81365\n      11-OCT-2012 00:05:07  3.84110\n      13-OCT-2012 09:11:49  3.48413\n      17-OCT-2012 23:45:09  2.89231\n      20-OCT-2012 08:51:56  2.87865\n      24-OCT-2012 17:52:37  2.91584\n      27-OCT-2012 02:59:07  2.95717\n      31-OCT-2012 21:14:06  3.26799\n      03-NOV-2012 06:20:59  3.35196\n      08-NOV-2012 00:34:10  3.76771\n      10-NOV-2012 09:41:17  3.95966\n      15-NOV-2012 02:05:08  4.14310\n      17-NOV-2012 11:11:41  4.26021\n      22-NOV-2012 05:13:52  4.42137\n      24-NOV-2012 14:10:07  4.17644\n      26-NOV-2012 23:06:32  4.13729\n      29-NOV-2012 09:52:37  4.24329\n      01-DEC-2012 20:38:11  4.15837\n      04-DEC-2012 07:24:06  4.06381\n      08-DEC-2012 15:43:35  3.14428\n      12-DEC-2012 18:13:41  2.99236\n \n      3) GPA reboots\n \n      During PM and XM the LGRS Gravity Processor Assemby (GPA)\n      rebooted several times resulting in the loss of Ka range and the\n      Time Transfer System (TTS) observables for about 1.5 minutes.\n      After a GPA reboot the LGRS clock is synched with the LGRS clock\n      on the non-rebooting spacecraft using the TTS system.

The complete\n      history for the antenna change are listed in the VGS1B product\n      (S-band) and VGX1B product (X-band).\n \n      6) Ka boresight vector calibrations\n \n      During the primary and extended missions, the GRAIL spacecraft\n      were in nominal science attitude called orbiter point attitude\n      mode. For this mode the solar arrays of the spacecraft are\n      parallel to the orbital plane and the Ka boresight vectors (2.1\n      degrees off the -Z axis in the YZ spacecraft frame) are pointed\n      in the direction of line of sight toward the other spacecraft.\n      The GRAIL spacecraft remained in orbit point attitude mode\n      except during Ka boresight vector calibration maneuvers when the\n      spacecraft performed two orthogonal slews of 3 deg about the\n      line of sight vector between the two spacecraft. The tables\n      below are showing all the Ka boresight calibration maneuvers for\n      each spacecraft. LGRS measurements are taken during the\n      maneuvers but should not be used in the science processing\n      because the measured range change is the sum of orbit geometry,\n      lunar gravity, and range change induced by spacecraft attitude\n      variation. Ka boresight vector data contain range corrections\n      for the phase center to center of mass offset during the\n      maneuvers but these corrections are not reliable and should not\n      be used.\n \n      PM GRAIL-A Ka boresight maneuvers\n \n      start time (UTC)      end time (UTC)\n      02-MAR-2012  19:20    02-MAR-2012  19:35\n      08-MAR-2012  20:05    08-MAR-2012  20:20\n      08-MAR-2012  21:05    08-MAR-2012  21:20\n      08-MAR-2012  16:54    08-MAR-2012  17:09\n      08-MAR-2012  17:55    08-MAR-2012  18:10\n      03-APR-2012  19:30    03-APR-2012  19:45\n      03-APR-2012  20:30    03-APR-2012  20:45\n      02-MAY-2012  16:40    02-MAY-2012  16:55\n      02-MAY-2012  17:40    02-MAY-2012  17:55\n      29-MAY-2012  09:21    29-MAY-2012  09:36\n      29-MAY-2012  11:15    29-MAY-2012  11:30\n \n      XM GRAIL-A Ka boresight maneuvers\n \n      start time (UTC)      end time (UTC)\n      05-SEP-2012  10:00    05-SEP-2012  10:15\n      05-SEP-2012  11:00    05-SEP-2012  11:15\n      12-SEP-2012  10:00    12-SEP-2012  10:15\n      12-SEP-2012  11:00    12-SEP-2012  11:15\n      19-SEP-2012  10:00    19-SEP-2012  10:15\n      19-SEP-2012  11:00    19-SEP-2012  11:15\n      26-SEP-2012  10:00    26-SEP-2012  10:15\n      26-SEP-2012  11:00    26-SEP-2012  11:15\n      03-OCT-2012  10:00    03-OCT-2012  10:15\n      03-OCT-2012  11:00    03-OCT-2012  11:15\n      10-OCT-2012  10:00    10-OCT-2012  10:15\n      10-OCT-2012  11:00    10-OCT-2012  11:15\n      17-OCT-2012  10:00    17-OCT-2012  10:15\n      17-OCT-2012  11:00    17-OCT-2012  11:15\n      24-OCT-2012  10:00    24-OCT-2012  10:15\n      24-OCT-2012  11:00    24-OCT-2012  11:15\n      31-OCT-2012  10:00    31-OCT-2012  10:15\n      31-OCT-2012  11:00    31-OCT-2012  11:15\n      07-NOV-2012  10:00    07-NOV-2012  10:15\n      07-NOV-2012  11:00    07-NOV-2012  11:15\n      14-NOV-2012  10:00    14-NOV-2012  10:15\n      14-NOV-2012  11:00    14-NOV-2012  11:15\n      21-NOV-2012  10:00    21-NOV-2012  10:15\n      21-NOV-2012  11:00    21-NOV-2012  11:15\n      28-NOV-2012  10:00    28-NOV-2012  10:15\n      28-NOV-2012  11:00    28-NOV-2012  11:15\n      08-DEC-2012  10:00    08-DEC-2012  10:15\n      08-DEC-2012  11:00    08-DEC-2012  11:15\n      11-DEC-2012  22:00    11-DEC-2012  22:15\n      11-DEC-2012  23:00    11-DEC-2012  23:15\n \n \n      Calibration Description - Spacecraft\n      ====================================\n      Performance calibrations were done on the ground and the\n      requirements for a measurement were met if science instrument\n      temperatures were used to calibrate the science measurements.\n      During the Prime Mission, other error sources dominated the\n      gravity field determination, but with the inclusion of the\n      Extended Mission, the temperature-correlated science\n      measurements will be applied.\n \n \n      Platform Mounting Descriptions - Spacecraft\n      ===========================================\n      Platform mounting is part of the instrument design. The\n      following antennas are mounted to each spacecraft:\n \n      - 2 S-band transponder antennas to communicate with Earth\n      (LGA1 & LGA2)\n      - 2 X-band beacon antennas for Doppler ranging measurements from\n      Earth of the Moon's near side (RSB1 & RSB2)\n      - S-band time-transfer system (TTS) antenna, which sends a\n      time-synchronization code back and forth between the spacecraft\n      - Ka-band ranging antenna for precision distance measurement\n      between the spacecraft\n \n      The spacecraft frame is defined such that the -Y axis of GRAIL-A\n      and the +Y axis of GRAIL-B point to nadir. The solar panels are\n      on the -X side of each spacecraft. The +/-Z axes of the\n      spacecraft are along the direction of flight.\n \n      The two S-Band transponder antennas are on opposite faces of the\n      spacecraft to provide full sky coverage. The LGA1 boresight is\n      along the -X axis of the spacecraft, facing in the direction of\n      the solar panels. LGA2 is on the opposite side, facing the +X\n      direction.\n \n      The two RSB antennas are oriented similarly, with RSB1 on the -X\n      side and RSB2 on the +X side. During the mission, transmissions\n      switch between the two in sync with the S-Band transponder\n      antennas.\n \n      The Ka-Band Antenna Assembly and the TTS are oriented along the\n      -Z axis of the spacecraft. Since these antennas point at each\n      other to form a communications link, one is always pointed in\n      the direction of flight while the other is pointed away. During\n      the prime mission, the direction of flight is along GRAIL-A's -Z\n      axis and GRAIL-B's +Z axis. During extended mission, they are\n      reversed. In addition, the antennae on each spacecraft are\n      rotated 45 degrees around their boresight, so that in the flight\n      configuration they form mirror images of each other. This allows\n      orthogonal polarizations to separate the transmit and receive\n      channels in the antenna.\n \n      For more specific information, see\n      lib_10_grail_coord_trans_rev1.pdf in the document directory.\n \n \n    Instrument Overview - DSN\n    =========================\n      Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near Barstow,\n      CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise the DSN\n      tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with several\n      antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High Efficiency\n      (HEF), and 34-m Beam WaveGuide (BWG)], associated electronics,\n      and operational systems.  Primary activity at each complex is\n      radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry data from\n      active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is possible in\n      several radio-frequency bands, the most common being S-band\n      (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a wavelength of\n      14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-3.5 cm).\n      Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kW are available.\n \n      Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded\n      waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis\n      of the received coding allows navigators to determine the\n      distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the\n      carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight spacecraft\n      velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used to calculate\n      the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity fields of objects\n      near the spacecraft.\n \n      Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have\n      propagated through or been scattered from target media.\n      Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with\n      surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer\n      physical and electrical properties of the target.\n \n      Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The\n        DMC receives and archives most of the information from the\n        NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their\n        operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well\n        as the handling and displaying of any responses to control\n        directives and configuration and status information received\n        from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The\n        effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and\n        archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC. Communication\n        among the various subsystems is done using a Local Area\n        Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a network\n        interface unit (NIU).\n \n \n      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem\n      ---------------------------------\n        Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from\n        the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m BWG antenna subnets.  The\n        antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors\n        which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio\n        frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large\n        collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy\n        onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and\n        angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for\n        gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between\n        zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as\n        5 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling\n        of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector\n        and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas\n        have 'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms\n        that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows\n        more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The\n        BWG reflector shape is ellipsoidal.\n \n        On the 70-m antennas, the subreflector directs received energy\n        from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a device which\n        reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn and passes\n        X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In the 34-m\n        HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which accepts both\n        frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate. In the 34-m\n        BWG, a series of small mirrors (approximately 2.5 meters in\n        diameter) directs microwave energy from the subreflector\n        region to a collection area at the base of the antenna --\n        typically in a pedestal room.  A retractable dichroic\n        reflector separates S- and X-band on some BWG antennas or X-\n        and Ka-band on others.  RF energy to be transmitted into space\n        by the horns is focused by the reflectors into narrow\n        cylindrical beams, pointed with high precision (either to the\n        dichroic plate or directly to the subreflector) by a series of\n        drive motors and gear trains that can rotate the movable\n        components and their support structures.\n \n        The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two\n        pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are\n        CONSCAN and 'blind pointing.' With CONSCAN enabled and a\n        closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the\n        system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around\n        its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are\n        computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied\n        by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly\n        (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the\n        Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern\n        to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the\n        receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal\n        level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan\n        position with the received signal level variations allows the\n        APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.\n        Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control\n        system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent\n        direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional\n        function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and\n        residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and\n        predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly\n        (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL\n        via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna\n        status monitoring.\n \n        During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low\n        received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an\n        occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under\n        these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and\n        pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined\n        Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.\n \n        Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least\n        the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received\n        Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain\n        experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may\n        be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on\n        elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal\n        degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs\n        (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)\n        which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC\n        passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to\n        the desired position.\n \n        Pointing angles for all antenna types are computed by\n        the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by\n        the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived\n        by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the\n        APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts\n        into AZ-EL coordinates.  The LMC operator then downloads the\n        antenna predict points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer\n        along with a selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts\n        consist of time-tagged AZ-EL points at selected time\n        intervals along with polynomial coefficients for\n        interpolation between points.\n \n        The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,\n        corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and\n        subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error\n        correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS\n        then sends angular position commands for each axis at the\n        rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate\n        commands are generated from the position commands at the\n        servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the\n        antenna.\n \n        When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for\n        spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using\n        'planetary mode' -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension\n        (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly\n        with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to\n        the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS\n        quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points\n        which are on one-day centers.\n \n        A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for\n        tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial\n        frame.\n \n        Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna\n        has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called\n        'precision' mode.  A pointing control loop derives the\n        main AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two-\n        axis autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference\n        Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a\n        precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive\n        system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main\n        antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft\n        encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-\n        elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by\n        measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light\n        beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by\n        moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.\n        Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are\n        possible in 'precision' mode.  The 'precision' mode is not\n        available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their\n        beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.\n \n \n      DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem\n      --------------------------------\n        70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones\n        installed in a structure at the center of the main reflector.\n        The feeds are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.\n        Selection of the feed is made by rotation of the\n        subreflector.  A dichroic mirror assembly, half on the S-band\n        cone and half on the X-band cone, permits simultaneous use of\n        the S- and X-band frequencies.  The third cone is devoted to\n        R&D and more specialized work.\n \n        The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-\n        and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them\n        through polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The\n        polarizer plates are adjusted so that the signals are\n        directed to a pair of redundant amplifiers for each\n        frequency, thus allowing simultaneous reception of signals in\n        two orthogonal polarizations.  For S-band these are two Block\n        IVA S-band Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the\n        amplifiers are Block IIA TWMs.\n \n        34-m HEF Antennas:  The 34-m HEF uses a single feed for both\n        S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S- and X-band receive as well as\n        X-band transmit is possible thanks to the presence of an S/X\n        'combiner' which acts as a diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP\n        is user selected through a switch so neither a polarizer nor\n        an orthomode transducer is needed.  X-band amplification\n        options include two Block II TWMs or an HEMT Low Noise\n        Amplifier (LNA).  S-band amplification is provided by an FET\n        LNA.\n \n        34-m BWG Antennas: These antennas use feeds and low-noise\n        amplifiers (LNA) in the pedestal room, which can be switched\n        in and out as needed.  Typically the following modes are\n        available:\n           1. downlink non-diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-1, with\n              uplink in the opposite circular polarization;\n           2. downlink non-diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-2, with\n              uplink in the opposite circular polarization\n           3. downlink diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-1, with\n              uplink in the same circular polarization\n           4. downlink diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-2, with\n              uplink in the same circular polarization\n        For BWG antennas with dual-band capabilities (e.g., DSS 25)\n        and dual LNAs, each of the above four modes can be used in a\n        single-frequency or dual-frequency configuration.  Thus, for\n        antennas with the most complete capabilities, there are\n        sixteen possible ways to receive at a single frequency\n        (2 polarizations, 2 waveguide path choices, 2 LNAs, and 2\n        bands).\n \n \n      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem\n      -------------------------------\n        The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of two groups of\n        equipment: the closed-loop receiver group and the open-loop\n        receiver group.  This subsystem is controlled by the\n        Receiver-Exciter Controller (REC) which communicates\n        directly with the DMC for predicts and OCI reception and\n        status reporting.\n \n        The exciter generates the S-band signal (or X-band for the\n        34-m HEF only) which is provided to the Transmitter Subsystem\n        for the spacecraft uplink signal.  It is tunable under\n        command of the Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO) which\n        receives predicts from the Metric Data Assembly (MDA).\n \n        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and\n        the feed horn for all three antennas (used for simultaneous\n        transmission and reception) may be configured such that it is\n        out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass\n        mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the\n        receiver system.\n \n        Closed Loop Receivers: The Block V receiver-exciter at the\n        70-m stations allows for two receiver channels, each capable\n        of L-Band (e.g., 1668 MHz frequency or 18 cm wavelength),\n        S-band, or X-band reception, and an S-band exciter for\n        generation of uplink signals through the low-power or\n        high-power transmitter.\n \n        The closed-loop receivers provide the capability for rapid\n        acquisition of a spacecraft signal and telemetry lockup.  In\n        order to accomplish acquisition within a short time, the\n        receivers are predict driven to search for, acquire, and\n        track the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition\n        precludes manual tuning though that remains as a backup\n        capability.  The subsystem utilizes FFT analyzers for rapid\n        acquisition.  The predicts are NSS generated, transmitted to\n        the CMC which sends them to the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem\n        where two sets can be stored.  The receiver starts\n        acquisition at uplink time plus one round-trip-light-time or\n        at operator specified times.  The receivers may also be\n        operated from the LMC without a local operator attending\n        them.  The receivers send performance and status data,\n        displays, and event messages to the LMC.\n \n        Either the exciter synthesizer signal or the simulation\n        (SIM) synthesizer signal is used as the reference for the\n        Doppler extractor in the closed-loop receiver systems,\n        depending on the spacecraft being tracked (and Project\n        guidelines).  The SIM synthesizer is not ramped; instead it\n        uses one constant frequency, the Track Synthesizer Frequency\n        (TSF), which is an average frequency for the entire pass.\n \n        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one\n        of three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It will be\n        configured such that the expected amplitude changes are\n        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth\n        (2BLo) will be configured such that the expected phase\n        changes can be accommodated while maintaining the best\n        possible loop SNR.\n \n        Open-Loop Receivers (OLR):  The OLR utilized a fixed first\n        Local Oscillator (LO) frequency and a tunable second LO\n        frequency to minimize phase noise and improve frequency\n        stability.  The OLR consisted of an RF-to-IF downconverter\n        located at the feed , an IF selection switch (IFS), and a\n        Radio Science Receiver (RSR).  The RF-IF downconverters\n        in the 70-m antennas were equipped for four IF channels:\n        S-RCP, S-LCP, X-RCP, and X-LCP.  The 34-m HEF stations\n        were equipped with a two-channel RF-IF: S-band and X-band.\n        The IFS switched the IF input among the antennas.\n \n \n      DSCC Transmitter Subsystem\n      --------------------------\n        The Transmitter Subsystem accepts the S-band frequency\n        exciter signal from the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem exciter\n        and amplifies it to the required transmit output level.  The\n        amplified signal is routed via the diplexer through the feed\n        horn to the antenna and then focused and beamed to the\n        spacecraft.\n \n        The Transmitter Subsystem power capabilities range from 18 kW\n        to 400 kW.  Power levels above 18 kW are available only at\n        70-m stations.\n \n \n      DSCC Tracking Subsystem\n      -----------------------\n        The Tracking Subsystem primary functions are to acquire and\n        maintain communications with the spacecraft and to generate\n        and format radiometric data containing Doppler and range.\n \n        The DSCC Tracking Subsystem (DTK) receives the carrier\n        signals and ranging spectra from the Receiver-Exciter\n        Subsystem.  The Doppler cycle counts are counted, formatted,\n        and transmitted to JPL in real time.  Ranging data are also\n        transmitted to JPL in real time.  Also contained in these\n        blocks is the AGC information from the Receiver-Exciter\n        Subsystem.  The Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT)\n        at JPL produces an Archival Tracking Data File (ATDF) which\n        contains Doppler and ranging data.\n \n        In addition, the Tracking Subsystem receives from the CMC\n        frequency predicts (used to compute frequency residuals and\n        noise estimates), receiver tuning predicts (used to tune the\n        closed-loop receivers), and uplink tuning predicts (used to\n        tune the exciter).  From the LMC, it receives configuration\n        and control directives as well as configuration and status\n        information on the transmitter, microwave, and frequency and\n        timing subsystems.\n \n        The Metric Data Assembly (MDA) controls all of the DTK\n        functions supporting the uplink and downlink activities.  The\n        MDA receives uplink predicts and controls the uplink tuning\n        by commanding the DCO.  The MDA also controls the Sequential\n        Ranging Assembly (SRA).  It formats the Doppler and range\n        measurements and provides them to the GCF for transmission to\n        NOCC.\n \n        The Sequential Ranging Assembly (SRA) measures the round trip\n        light time (RTLT) of a radio signal traveling from a ground\n        tracking station to a spacecraft and back.  From the RTLT,\n        phase, and Doppler data, the spacecraft range can be\n        determined.  A coded signal is modulated on an uplink carrier\n        and transmitted to the spacecraft where it is detected and\n        transponded back to the ground station.  As a result, the\n        signal received at the tracking station is delayed by its\n        round trip through space and shifted in frequency by the\n        Doppler effect due to the relative motion between the\n        spacecraft and the tracking station on Earth.\n \n \n      DSCC Frequency and Timing Subsystem\n      -----------------------------------\n        The Frequency and Timing Subsystem (FTS) provides all\n        frequency and timing references required by the other DSCC\n        subsystems.  It contains four frequency standards of which\n        one is prime and the other three are backups.  Selection of\n        the prime standard is done via the CMC.  Of these four\n        standards, two are hydrogen masers followed by clean-up loops\n        (CUL) and two are cesium standards.  These four standards all\n        feed the Coherent Reference Generator (CRG) which provides\n        the frequency references used by the rest of the complex.  It\n        also provides the frequency reference to the Master Clock\n        Assembly (MCA) which in turn provides time to the Time\n        Insertion and Distribution Assembly (TID) which provides UTC\n        and SIM-time to the complex.\n \n        JPL's ability to monitor the FTS at each DSCC is limited to\n        the MDA calculated Doppler pseudo-residuals, the Doppler\n        noise, the SSI, and to a system which uses the Global\n        Positioning System (GPS).  GPS receivers at each DSCC receive\n        a one-pulse-per-second pulse from the station's (hydrogen\n        maser referenced) FTS and a pulse from a GPS satellite at\n        scheduled times.  After compensating for the satellite signal\n        delay, the timing offset is reported to JPL where a database\n        is kept.  The clock offsets stored in the JPL database are\n        given in microseconds; each entry is a mean reading of\n        measurements from several GPS satellites and a time tag\n        associated with the mean reading.  The clock offsets provided\n        include those of SPC 10 relative to UTC (NIST), SPC 40\n        relative to SPC 10, etc.\n \n \n      Radio Science Receiver (RSR)\n      ----------------------------\n        A radio frequency (RF) spacecraft signal at S-band, X-band,\n        or Ka-band is captured by a receiving antenna on Earth, down\n        converted to an intermediate frequency (IF) near 300 MHz and\n        then fed via a distribution network to one input of an IF\n        Selector Switch (IFS).  The IFS allows each RSR to select any\n        of the available input signals for its RSR Digitizer (DIG).\n        Within the RSR the digitized signal is then passed to the\n        Digitial Down Converter (DDC), VME Data Processor (VDP), and\n        Data Processor (DP) [JPLD-16765].\n \n        \\       -----------      ------      -----      -----   -----\n         \\     | RF  TO IF |    |      |----|     |    |     | |     |\n          |----|    DOWN   |----|      |----|     |----| DIG | |  DP |\n         /     | CONVERTER |    |      |----|     |    |     | |     |\n        /       -----------     |  IF  |----| IFS |     -----   -----\n        ANTENNA               --| DIST |----|     |       |       |\n                300 MHz IF    --|      | .. |     |     -----   -----\n                FROM OTHER    --|      |----|     |    |     | |     |\n                 ANTENNAS     --|      |     -----     | DDC | | VDP |\n                                 ------                |     | |     |\n                                                        -----   -----\n                                                          |       |\n                                                           -------\n \n        In the DIG the IF signal is passed through a programmable\n        attenuator, adjusted to provide the proper level to the\n        Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).  The attenuated signal is\n        then passed through a Band Pass Filter (BPF) which selects a\n        frequency band in the range 265-375 MHz.  The filtered output\n        from the BPF is then mixed with a 256 MHz Local Oscillator\n        (LO), low pass filtered (LPF), and sampled by the ADC.  The\n        output of the ADC is a stream of 8-bit real samples at 256\n        Msamples/second (Msps).  DIG timing is derived from the\n        station FTS 5 MHz clock and 1 pulse per second (1PPS)\n        reference; the DIG generates a 256 MHz clock signal for later\n        processing.  The 1PPS signal marks the data sample taken at\n        the start of each second.\n \n        The DDC selects one 16 MHz subchannel from the possible 128\n        MHz bandwidth available from the DIG by using Finite Impulse\n        Response (FIR) filters with revolving banks of filter\n        coefficients.  The sample stream from the DIG is separated\n        into eight decimated streams, each of which is fed into two\n        sets of FIR filters.  One set of filters produces in-phase\n        (I) 8-bit data while the other produces quadrature-phase (Q)\n        8-bit data.  The center frequency of the desired 16 MHz\n        channel is adjustable in 1 MHz steps and is usually chosen to\n        be near the spacecraft carrier frequency.  After combining\n        the I and Q sample streams, the DDC feeds the samples to the\n        VDP.  The DDC also converts the 256 MHz data clock and 1PPS\n        signals into a msec time code, which is also passed to the\n        VDP.\n \n        The VDP contains a quadruply-redundant set of custom boards\n        which are controlled by a real-time control computer (RT).\n        Each set of boards comprises a numerically controlled\n        oscillator (NCO), a complex multiplier, a decimating FIR\n        filter, and a data packer.  The 16 Msps complex samples\n        from the DDC are digitally mixed with the NCO signal in the\n        complex multiplier.  The NCO phase and frequency are updated\n        every millisecond by the RT and are selected so that the\n        center frequency of the desired portion of the 16 MHz channel\n        is down-converted to 0 Hz.  The RT uses polynomials derived\n        from frequency predictions.  The output of the complex\n        multiplier is sent to the decimating FIR filter where its\n        bandwidth and sample rate are reduced (see table below).  The\n        decimating FIR filter also allows adjustment of the\n        sub-channel gain to take full advantage of the dynamic range\n        available in the hardware.  The data packer truncates samples\n        to 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bits by dropping the least significant\n        bits and packs them into 32-bit data words.  Q-samples are\n        packed into the first 16 bits of the word, and I-samples into\n        the least significant 16 bits (see below).

In addition to the samples, each data\n        record includes header information such as time tags and NCO\n        frequency and phase that are necessary for analysis.  The DP\n        processes the data records to provide monitor data, such as\n        power spectra.  If recording has been enabled, the records\n        are stored by the DP.\n \n \n        NCO Phase and Frequency\n        -----------------------\n          At the start of each DSN pass, the RSR is provided with a\n          file containing a list of predicted frequencies. Using\n          these points, the RT computes expected sky frequencies at\n          the beginning, middle, and end of each one second time\n          interval. Based on the local oscillator frequencies\n          selected and any offsets entered, the RT computes the\n          coefficients of a frequency polynomial fitted to the DDC\n          channel frequencies at these three times.  The RT also\n          computes a phase polynomial by integrating the frequency\n          polynomial and matching phases at the one second\n          boundaries.\n \n          The phase and frequency of the VDP NCO's are computed every\n          millisecond (000-999) from the polynomial coefficients as\n          follows:\n \n              nco_phase(msec) = phase_coef_1 +\n                                phase_coef_2 * (msec/1000) +\n                                phase_coef_3 * (msec/1000)**2 +\n                                phase_coef_4 * (msec/1000)**3\n \n              nco_freq(msec)  = freq_coef_1 +\n                                freq_coef_2 * ((msec + 0.5)/1000) +\n                                freq_coef_3 * ((msec + 0.5)/1000)**2\n \n \n          The sky frequency may be reconstructed using\n \n                  sky_freq = RF_to_IF_LO +\n                             DDC_LO -\n                             nco_freq +\n                             reside_freq\n \n            where  RF_to_IF_LO  is the down conversion from the\n                                microwave frequency to IF (bytes\n                                42-43 in the data record header)\n                   DDC_LO       is the down-conversion applied in the\n                                DIG and DDC (bytes 40-41 in the data\n                                record header)\n                   Resid_Freq   is the frequency of the signal in the\n                                VDP output\n \n \n    Detectors - DSN\n    ===============\n      Nominal carrier tracking loop threshold noise bandwidth at\n      X-band is 10 Hz.

No information on specific calibration\n      activities is available.  Nominal performance specifications\n      are shown in the tables above.  Additional information may be\n      available in [DSN810-5].\n \n      Prior to each tracking pass, station operators perform a series\n      of calibrations to ensure that systems meet specifications for\n      that operational period.  Included in these calibrations is\n      measurement of receiver system temperature in the configuration\n      to be employed during the pass.  Results of these calibrations\n      are recorded in (hard copy) Controller's Logs for each pass.\n \n      The nominal procedure for initializing open-loop receiver\n      attenuator settings is described below.  In cases where widely\n      varying signal levels are expected, the procedure may be\n      modified in advance or real-time adjustments may be made to\n      attenuator settings.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations - DSN\n    ================================\n      The DSN is a complex and dynamic 'instrument.' Its performance\n      for Radio Science depends on a number of factors from equipment\n      configuration to meteorological conditions.  No specific\n      information on 'operational considerations' can be given here.\n \n \n    Operational Modes - DSN\n    =======================\n \n      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem\n      ---------------------------------\n        Pointing of DSCC antennas may be carried out in several ways.\n        For details see the subsection 'DSCC Antenna Mechanical\n        Subsystem' in the 'Subsystem' section.  Binary pointing is\n        the preferred mode for tracking spacecraft; pointing\n        predicts are provided, and the antenna simply follows those.\n        With CONSCAN, the antenna scans conically about the optimum\n        pointing direction, using closed-loop receiver signal\n        strength estimates as feedback.  In planetary mode, the\n        system interpolates from three (slowly changing) RA-DEC\n        target coordinates; this is 'blind' pointing since there is\n        no feedback from a detected signal.  In sidereal mode, the\n        antenna tracks a fixed point on the celestial sphere.  In\n        'precision' mode, the antenna pointing is adjusted using an\n        optical feedback system.  It is possible on most antennas to\n        freeze z-axis motion of the subreflector to minimize phase\n        changes in the received signal.\n \n \n      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem\n      -------------------------------\n        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and\n        the feed horns on all antennas may be configured so\n        that it is out of the received signal path in order to\n        improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver system.\n        This is known as the 'listen-only' or 'bypass' mode.\n \n \n      Closed-Loop Receiver AGC Loop\n      -----------------------------\n        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of\n        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  Ordinarily it is\n        configured so that expected signal amplitude changes are\n        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth is\n        ordinarily configured so that expected phase changes can be\n        accommodated while maintaining the best possible loop SNR.\n \n \n      Coherent vs. Non-Coherent Operation\n      -----------------------------------\n        The frequency of the signal transmitted from the spacecraft\n        can generally be controlled in two ways -- by locking to a\n        signal received from a ground station or by locking to an\n        on-board oscillator.  These are known as the coherent (or\n        'two-way') and non-coherent ('one-way') modes, respectively.\n        Mode selection is made at the spacecraft, based on commands\n        received from the ground.  When operating in the coherent\n        mode, the transponder carrier frequency is derived from the\n        received uplink carrier frequency with a 'turn-around ratio'\n        typically of 880/749.  In the non-coherent mode, the\n        downlink carrier frequency is derived from the spacecraft\n        on-board crystal-controlled oscillator.  Either closed-loop\n        or open-loop receivers (or both) can be used with either\n        spacecraft frequency reference mode.  Closed-loop reception\n        in two-way mode is usually preferred for routine tracking.\n        Occasionally the spacecraft operates coherently while two\n        ground stations receive the 'downlink' signal; this is\n        sometimes known as the 'three-way' mode.\n \n \n    Location - DSN\n    ==============\n      Station locations are documented in [DSN810-005-301H].

stations -- in this\n      case, at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). The spacecraft part\n      of the radio science instrument is described immediately below;\n      that is followed by a description of the DSN (ground) part of the\n      instrument.\n \n \n    Instrument Specifications - Spacecraft\n    ======================================\n \n      Instrument Id                  : LGRS-B\n      Instrument Host Id             : GRAIL-B\n      PI PDS User Id                 : UNK\n      Instrument Name                : LUNAR GRAVITY RANGING SYSTEM B\n      Instrument Type                : RADIO SCIENCE\n      Build Date                     : UNK\n      Instrument Mass                : UNK\n      Instrument Length              : UNK\n      Instrument Width               : UNK\n      Instrument Height              : UNK\n      Instrument Manufacturer Name   : UNK\n \n \n    Instrument Overview - Spacecraft\n    ================================\n      The Lunar Gravity Ranging System (LGRS) instruments on board the\n      twin GRAIL spacecraft generate radio signals at Ka-band, X-band,\n      and S-band. The time and frequency of each signal is referenced\n      to its respective Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO).  The Ka-band\n      and S-band signals are captured by the other spacecraft, and\n      precise measurements of signal properties are recorded for later\n      transmission to Earth.  The X-band link is received by stations\n      of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). Operations are continuous\n      and simultaneous on both spacecraft except that the X-Band\n      downlink to Earth is only used when a DSN station is available.\n \n      The sinusoidal Ka-band link is used to determine distance\n      (range) between the two spacecraft from the phase of the\n      received signal. The modulated S-band signal is for exchange of\n      Timing and Time Synchronization (TTS). The X-band link is a\n      one-way transmission to the DSN via the Radio Science Beacon\n      (RSB).\n \n      Except for mounting differences, LGRS-A and LGRS-B (on GRAIL-A\n      and GRAIL-B, respectively) are identical.  Each is responsible\n      for working with its twin to send and receive the signals needed\n      to accurately and precisely measure the changes in range between\n      the two orbiters. Each LGRS consists of an Ultra-Stable\n      Oscillator (USO), Microwave Assembly (MWA), a Time-Transfer\n      Assembly (TTA), and the Gravity Recovery Processor Assembly\n      (GPA).\n \n      The USO provides a steady reference signal that is used by all\n      of the instrument subsystems. Within the LGRS, the USO provides\n      the reference frequency for the MWA and the TTA. The MWA\n      converts the USO reference signal to the Ka-band frequency,\n      which is transmitted to the other orbiter.\n \n      The function of the TTA is to provide a two-way time-transfer\n      link between the spacecraft both to synchronize and to measure\n      the clock offset between the two LGRS clocks. The TTA generates\n      an S-band signal from the USO reference frequency and sends a\n      GPS-like ranging code to the other spacecraft. The GPA combines\n      all the inputs received from the MWA and TTA to produce the\n      radiometric data that are downlinked to the ground.\n \n      Finally, each Radio Science Beacon (RSB) transmits an X-Band\n      signal to the ground based on its USO; the drift of the USO is\n      derived from the one-way Doppler data.\n \n \n      Science Objectives\n      ==================\n      The inter-spacecraft radio links and the X-band radio link to\n      Earth are used to generate a high resolution gravitational field\n      of the Moon.\n \n \n      Operational Considerations - Spacecraft\n      =======================================\n      GRAIL Primary Mission (PM) & Extended Mission (XM) operational\n      considerations\n \n      The GRAIL PM started on March 01, 2012 and ended on May 29,\n      2012.  The GRAIL XM started on August 29, 2012, and ended on\n      December 12, 2012, followed by decommissioning from December 12,\n      2012, to December 18, 2012. Spacecraft events for these phases\n      (for example, propulsive maneuvers, Ka boresight calibration\n      attitude maneuvers, telecommunication configuration changes and\n      the science Lunar Gravity Ranging System (LGRS) events) are\n      described below including their impact on science processing.\n \n      1)Propulsive Maneuvers\n \n      During PM, there were propulsive maneuvers for GRAIL-B but not\n      for GRAIL-A.\n \n      During the XM, weekly Eccentricity Correction Maneuvers (ECM)\n      were needed on both GRAIL spacecraft to correct rapid orbit\n      eccentricity changes due to large gravity variations at low\n      altitudes. The ECMs were between 5 and 15 m/sec and required\n      near radial thrusting which meant that the science measurements\n      were interrupted for about 15 minutes while the spacecraft\n      executed the ECMs. In the day following the ECMs a cleanup Orbit\n      Trim Maneuver (OTM) maneuver was executed if needed. The OTMs in\n      general were at the cm/sec level and science measurements were\n      not interrupted during an OTM.\n \n      The mass change history for both spacecraft can be found in the\n      MAS1A/B Level-1 products and the thruster on-times are available\n      in the THR1A/B level-1 products. LGRS measurements are taken\n      during the propulsive maneuvers but it is recommended to break\n      science data arcs at the propulsive maneuver event times, since\n      the velocity changes imparted on the spacecraft are not known\n      with sufficient accuracy for science processing.\n \n PM GRAIL-B Propulsive Maneuvers\n \nstart time               end time                 duration  dV        comment\n(TDB)                    (TDB)                    (sec)     (mm/sec)\n2012-03-30 18:42:45.776  2012-03-30 18:44:19.651  93.875    28.0      OTM-B2\n \nXM GRAIL-B Propulsive Maneuvers\n \nstart time               end time                 duration  dV        comment\n(TDB)                    (TDB)                    (sec)     (mm/sec)\n2012-09-10 15:16:20.626  2012-09-10 15:18:35.782  135.156    9680.0   ECM-B4\n2012-09-17 16:53:01.102  2012-09-17 16:55:21.652  140.551   10590.0   ECM-B5\n2012-09-24 11:18:37.600  2012-09-24 11:20:54.975  137.375    9780.0   ECM-B6\n2012-10-01 14:27:34.071  2012-10-01 14:29:29.809  115.738    8050.0   ECM-B7\n2012-10-08 15:42:50.548  2012-10-08 15:44:19.119   88.570    5940.0   ECM-B8\n2012-10-15 15:37:34.030  2012-10-15 15:39:47.049   33.019    9460.0   ECM-B9\n2012-10-22 09:56:15.529  2012-10-22 09:58:12.689   17.160    8510.0   ECM-B10\n2012-10-29 12:59:13.000  2012-10-29 13:01:19.688  126.687    9110.0   ECM-B11\n2012-11-05 16:08:33.472  2012-11-05 16:11:19.796  166.324   12170.0   ECM-B12\n2012-11-12 16:16:36.952  2012-11-12 16:19:11.773  154.820   11120.0   ECM-B13\n2012-11-19 19:41:10.423  2012-11-19 19:42:35.638   85.215    5680.0   ECM-B14\n2012-11-29 17:27:03.689  2012-11-29 17:27:20.294   16.605       4.0   OTM-B5\n2012-12-06 15:36:20.176  2012-12-06 15:38:00.777  100.601    6860.0   ECM-B15\n2012-12-10 17:44:16.873  2012-12-10 17:46:55.552  158.680   11370.0   ECM-B16\n2012-12-14 15:08:45.584  2012-12-14 15:09:55.885   70.301    4520.0   ECM-B17\n2012-12-17 21:36:27.342  2012-12-17 21:41:48.748  321.406   25970.0   BTD-B\n \n      2) Angular momentum desaturation maneuvers\n \n      The GRAIL spacecraft attitude is maintained with angular\n      momentum wheels. The angular momentum wheels apply torques on\n      the spacecraft by spinning up or down to maintain attitude. The\n      angular momentum wheels are only allowed to operate within a\n      specified wheel speed range. If the wheel speeds exceed the\n      specified range then attitude control thrusters (desaturation\n      maneuver) are used to apply a torque on the spacecraft to slow\n      or speed up the wheels, such that the resulting wheel speed is\n      within the specified range. In general the wheel speeds are\n      predictable, the desaturation maneuvers are planned in\n      advance, and the burns occur over the lunar poles. Since the\n      attitude control thrusters are not perfectly balanced, a\n      velocity is imparted on the spacecraft for every maneuver. The\n      velocity changes in general are small (< 5 mm/sec). LGRS\n      measurements are taken during the desaturation maneuvers but it\n      is recommended to break science data arcs at the desaturation\n      maneuver event times, since the velocity changes imparted on the\n      spacecraft are not known with sufficient accuracy for science\n      processing. A table for all desaturation events is shown below\n      for each spacecraft. The time reported in the table is the\n      average for all thruster activations associated with one\n      desaturation event. For detailed thruster on time histories see\n      level-1 product THR1A/B. The spacecraft mass change is very\n      small at the level of a few grams per event.

The complete\n      history for the antenna change are listed in the VGS1B product\n      (S-band) and VGX1B product (X-band).\n \n      6) Ka boresight vector calibrations\n \n      During the primary and extended missions, the GRAIL spacecraft\n      were in nominal science attitude called orbiter point attitude\n      mode. For this mode the solar arrays of the spacecraft are\n      parallel to the orbital plane and the Ka boresight vectors (2.1\n      degrees off the -Z axis in the YZ spacecraft frame) are pointed\n      in the direction of line of sight toward the other spacecraft.\n      The GRAIL spacecraft remained in orbit point attitude mode\n      except during Ka boresight vector calibration maneuvers when the\n      spacecraft performed two orthogonal slews of 3 deg about the\n      line of sight vector between the two spacecraft. The tables\n      below are showing all the Ka boresight calibration maneuvers for\n      each spacecraft. LGRS measurements are taken during the\n      maneuvers but should not be used in the science processing\n      because the measured range change is the sum of orbit geometry,\n      lunar gravity, and range change induced by spacecraft attitude\n      variation. Ka boresight vector data contain range corrections\n      for the phase center to center of mass offset during the\n      maneuvers but these corrections are not reliable and should not\n      be used.\n \n      PM GRAIL-B Ka boresight maneuvers\n \n      start time (UTC)      end time (UTC)\n      02-MAR-2012  19:00    02-MAR-2012  19:15\n      08-MAR-2012  19:45    08-MAR-2012  20:00\n      08-MAR-2012  20:45    08-MAR-2012  21:00\n      08-MAR-2012  16:34    08-MAR-2012  16:49\n      08-MAR-2012  17:35    08-MAR-2012  17:50\n      03-APR-2012  19:10    03-APR-2012  19:25\n      03-APR-2012  20:10    03-APR-2012  20:25\n      02-MAY-2012  16:20    02-MAY-2012  16:35\n      02-MAY-2012  17:20    02-MAY-2012  17:35\n      29-MAY-2012  09:41    29-MAY-2012  09:56\n      29-MAY-2012  11:35    29-MAY-2012  11:50\n \n      XM GRAIL-B Ka boresight maneuvers table\n \n      start time (UTC)      end time (UTC)\n      05-SEP-2012  10:20    05-SEP-2012  10:35\n      05-SEP-2012  11:20    05-SEP-2012  11:35\n      12-SEP-2012  10:20    12-SEP-2012  10:35\n      12-SEP-2012  11:20    12-SEP-2012  11:35\n      19-SEP-2012  10:20    19-SEP-2012  10:35\n      19-SEP-2012  11:20    19-SEP-2012  11:35\n      26-SEP-2012  10:20    26-SEP-2012  10:35\n      26-SEP-2012  11:20    26-SEP-2012  11:35\n      03-OCT-2012  10:20    03-OCT-2012  10:35\n      03-OCT-2012  11:20    03-OCT-2012  11:35\n      10-OCT-2012  10:20    10-OCT-2012  10:35\n      10-OCT-2012  11:20    10-OCT-2012  11:35\n      17-OCT-2012  10:20    17-OCT-2012  10:35\n      17-OCT-2012  11:20    17-OCT-2012  11:35\n      24-OCT-2012  10:20    24-OCT-2012  10:35\n      24-OCT-2012  11:20    24-OCT-2012  11:35\n      31-OCT-2012  10:20    31-OCT-2012  10:35\n      31-OCT-2012  11:20    31-OCT-2012  11:35\n      07-NOV-2012  10:20    07-NOV-2012  10:35\n      07-NOV-2012  11:20    07-NOV-2012  11:35\n      14-NOV-2012  10:20    14-NOV-2012  10:35\n      14-NOV-2012  11:20    14-NOV-2012  11:35\n      21-NOV-2012  10:20    21-NOV-2012  10:35\n      21-NOV-2012  11:20    21-NOV-2012  11:35\n      28-NOV-2012  10:20    28-NOV-2012  10:35\n      28-NOV-2012  11:20    28-NOV-2012  11:35\n      08-DEC-2012  10:20    08-DEC-2012  10:35\n      08-DEC-2012  11:20    08-DEC-2012  11:35\n      11-DEC-2012  22:20    11-DEC-2012  22:35\n      11-DEC-2012  23:20    11-DEC-2012  23:35\n \n \n      Calibration Description - Spacecraft\n      ====================================\n      Performance calibrations were done on the ground and the\n      requirements for a measurement were met if science instrument\n      temperatures were used to calibrate the science measurements.\n      During the Prime Mission, other error sources dominated the\n      gravity field determination, but with the inclusion of the\n      Extended Mission, the temperature-correlated science\n      measurements will be applied.\n \n \n      Platform Mounting Descriptions - Spacecraft\n      ===========================================\n      Platform mounting is part of the instrument design. The\n      following antennas are mounted to each spacecraft:\n \n      - 2 S-band transponder antennas to communicate with Earth\n      (LGA1 & LGA2)\n      - 2 X-band beacon antennas for Doppler ranging measurements from\n      Earth of the Moon's near side (RSB1 & RSB2)\n      - S-band time-transfer system (TTS) antenna, which sends a\n      time-synchronization code back and forth between the spacecraft\n      - Ka-band ranging antenna for precision distance measurement\n      between the spacecraft\n \n      The spacecraft frame is defined such that the -Y axis of GRAIL-A\n      and the +Y axis of GRAIL-B point to nadir. The solar panels are\n      on the -X side of each spacecraft. The +/-Z axes of the\n      spacecraft are along the direction of flight.\n \n      The two S-Band transponder antennas are on opposite faces of the\n      spacecraft to provide full sky coverage. The LGA1 boresight is\n      along the -X axis of the spacecraft, facing in the direction of\n      the solar panels. LGA2 is on the opposite side, facing the +X\n      direction.\n \n      The two RSB antennas are oriented similarly, with RSB1 on the -X\n      side and RSB2 on the +X side. During the mission, transmissions\n      switch between the two in sync with the S-Band transponder\n      antennas.\n \n      The Ka-Band Antenna Assembly and the TTS are oriented along the\n      -Z axis of the spacecraft. Since these antennas point at each\n      other to form a communications link, one is always pointed in\n      the direction of flight while the other is pointed away. During\n      the prime mission, the direction of flight is along GRAIL-A's -Z\n      axis and GRAIL-B's +Z axis. During extended mission, they are\n      reversed. In addition, the antennae on each spacecraft are\n      rotated 45 degrees around their boresight, so that in the flight\n      configuration they form mirror images of each other. This allows\n      orthogonal polarizations to separate the transmit and receive\n      channels in the antenna.\n \n      For more specific information, see\n      lib_10_grail_coord_trans_rev1.pdf in the document directory.\n \n \n    Instrument Overview - DSN\n    =========================\n      Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near Barstow,\n      CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise the DSN\n      tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with several\n      antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High Efficiency\n      (HEF), and 34-m Beam WaveGuide (BWG)], associated electronics,\n      and operational systems.  Primary activity at each complex is\n      radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry data from\n      active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is possible in\n      several radio-frequency bands, the most common being S-band\n      (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a wavelength of\n      14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-3.5 cm).\n      Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kW are available.\n \n      Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded\n      waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis\n      of the received coding allows navigators to determine the\n      distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the\n      carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight spacecraft\n      velocity.

Their system performance directly\n      determines the degree of success of Radio Science\n      investigations, and their system calibration determines the\n      degree of accuracy in the results of the experiments.  The\n      following paragraphs describe the functions performed by the\n      individual subsystems of a DSCC.  This material has been\n      adapted from [ASMARETAL1995] and [JPLD-14027]; for additional\n      information, consult [DSN810-5].\n \n      Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing\n      Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion\n      Laboratory (JPL).

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The\n        DMC receives and archives most of the information from the\n        NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their\n        operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well\n        as the handling and displaying of any responses to control\n        directives and configuration and status information received\n        from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The\n        effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and\n        archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC. Communication\n        among the various subsystems is done using a Local Area\n        Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a network\n        interface unit (NIU).\n \n \n      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem\n      ---------------------------------\n        Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from\n        the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m BWG antenna subnets.  The\n        antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors\n        which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio\n        frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large\n        collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy\n        onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and\n        angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for\n        gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between\n        zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as\n        5 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling\n        of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector\n        and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas\n        have 'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms\n        that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows\n        more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The\n        BWG reflector shape is ellipsoidal.\n \n        On the 70-m antennas, the subreflector directs received energy\n        from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a device which\n        reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn and passes\n        X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In the 34-m\n        HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which accepts both\n        frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate. In the 34-m\n        BWG, a series of small mirrors (approximately 2.5 meters in\n        diameter) directs microwave energy from the subreflector\n        region to a collection area at the base of the antenna --\n        typically in a pedestal room.  A retractable dichroic\n        reflector separates S- and X-band on some BWG antennas or X-\n        and Ka-band on others.  RF energy to be transmitted into space\n        by the horns is focused by the reflectors into narrow\n        cylindrical beams, pointed with high precision (either to the\n        dichroic plate or directly to the subreflector) by a series of\n        drive motors and gear trains that can rotate the movable\n        components and their support structures.\n \n        The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two\n        pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are\n        CONSCAN and 'blind pointing.' With CONSCAN enabled and a\n        closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the\n        system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around\n        its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are\n        computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied\n        by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly\n        (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the\n        Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern\n        to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the\n        receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal\n        level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan\n        position with the received signal level variations allows the\n        APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.\n        Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control\n        system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent\n        direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional\n        function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and\n        residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and\n        predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly\n        (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL\n        via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna\n        status monitoring.\n \n        During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low\n        received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an\n        occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under\n        these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and\n        pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined\n        Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.\n \n        Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least\n        the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received\n        Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain\n        experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may\n        be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on\n        elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal\n        degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs\n        (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)\n        which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC\n        passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to\n        the desired position.\n \n        Pointing angles for all antenna types are computed by\n        the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by\n        the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived\n        by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the\n        APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts\n        into AZ-EL coordinates.  The LMC operator then downloads the\n        antenna predict points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer\n        along with a selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts\n        consist of time-tagged AZ-EL points at selected time\n        intervals along with polynomial coefficients for\n        interpolation between points.\n \n        The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,\n        corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and\n        subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error\n        correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS\n        then sends angular position commands for each axis at the\n        rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate\n        commands are generated from the position commands at the\n        servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the\n        antenna.\n \n        When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for\n        spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using\n        'planetary mode' -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension\n        (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly\n        with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to\n        the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS\n        quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points\n        which are on one-day centers.\n \n        A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for\n        tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial\n        frame.\n \n        Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna\n        has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called\n        'precision' mode.  A pointing control loop derives the\n        main AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two-\n        axis autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference\n        Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a\n        precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive\n        system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main\n        antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft\n        encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-\n        elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by\n        measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light\n        beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by\n        moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.\n        Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are\n        possible in 'precision' mode.  The 'precision' mode is not\n        available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their\n        beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.\n \n \n      DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem\n      --------------------------------\n        70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones\n        installed in a structure at the center of the main reflector.\n        The feeds are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.\n        Selection of the feed is made by rotation of the\n        subreflector.  A dichroic mirror assembly, half on the S-band\n        cone and half on the X-band cone, permits simultaneous use of\n        the S- and X-band frequencies.  The third cone is devoted to\n        R&D and more specialized work.\n \n        The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-\n        and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them\n        through polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The\n        polarizer plates are adjusted so that the signals are\n        directed to a pair of redundant amplifiers for each\n        frequency, thus allowing simultaneous reception of signals in\n        two orthogonal polarizations.  For S-band these are two Block\n        IVA S-band Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the\n        amplifiers are Block IIA TWMs.\n \n        34-m HEF Antennas:  The 34-m HEF uses a single feed for both\n        S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S- and X-band receive as well as\n        X-band transmit is possible thanks to the presence of an S/X\n        'combiner' which acts as a diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP\n        is user selected through a switch so neither a polarizer nor\n        an orthomode transducer is needed.  X-band amplification\n        options include two Block II TWMs or an HEMT Low Noise\n        Amplifier (LNA).  S-band amplification is provided by an FET\n        LNA.\n \n        34-m BWG Antennas: These antennas use feeds and low-noise\n        amplifiers (LNA) in the pedestal room, which can be switched\n        in and out as needed.  Typically the following modes are\n        available:\n           1. downlink non-diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-1, with\n              uplink in the opposite circular polarization;\n           2. downlink non-diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-2, with\n              uplink in the opposite circular polarization\n           3. downlink diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-1, with\n              uplink in the same circular polarization\n           4. downlink diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-2, with\n              uplink in the same circular polarization\n        For BWG antennas with dual-band capabilities (e.g., DSS 25)\n        and dual LNAs, each of the above four modes can be used in a\n        single-frequency or dual-frequency configuration.  Thus, for\n        antennas with the most complete capabilities, there are\n        sixteen possible ways to receive at a single frequency\n        (2 polarizations, 2 waveguide path choices, 2 LNAs, and 2\n        bands).\n \n \n      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem\n      -------------------------------\n        The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of two groups of\n        equipment: the closed-loop receiver group and the open-loop\n        receiver group.  This subsystem is controlled by the\n        Receiver-Exciter Controller (REC) which communicates\n        directly with the DMC for predicts and OCI reception and\n        status reporting.\n \n        The exciter generates the S-band signal (or X-band for the\n        34-m HEF only) which is provided to the Transmitter Subsystem\n        for the spacecraft uplink signal.  It is tunable under\n        command of the Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO) which\n        receives predicts from the Metric Data Assembly (MDA).\n \n        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and\n        the feed horn for all three antennas (used for simultaneous\n        transmission and reception) may be configured such that it is\n        out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass\n        mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the\n        receiver system.\n \n        Closed Loop Receivers: The Block V receiver-exciter at the\n        70-m stations allows for two receiver channels, each capable\n        of L-Band (e.g., 1668 MHz frequency or 18 cm wavelength),\n        S-band, or X-band reception, and an S-band exciter for\n        generation of uplink signals through the low-power or\n        high-power transmitter.\n \n        The closed-loop receivers provide the capability for rapid\n        acquisition of a spacecraft signal and telemetry lockup.  In\n        order to accomplish acquisition within a short time, the\n        receivers are predict driven to search for, acquire, and\n        track the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition\n        precludes manual tuning though that remains as a backup\n        capability.  The subsystem utilizes FFT analyzers for rapid\n        acquisition.  The predicts are NSS generated, transmitted to\n        the CMC which sends them to the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem\n        where two sets can be stored.  The receiver starts\n        acquisition at uplink time plus one round-trip-light-time or\n        at operator specified times.  The receivers may also be\n        operated from the LMC without a local operator attending\n        them.  The receivers send performance and status data,\n        displays, and event messages to the LMC.\n \n        Either the exciter synthesizer signal or the simulation\n        (SIM) synthesizer signal is used as the reference for the\n        Doppler extractor in the closed-loop receiver systems,\n        depending on the spacecraft being tracked (and Project\n        guidelines).  The SIM synthesizer is not ramped; instead it\n        uses one constant frequency, the Track Synthesizer Frequency\n        (TSF), which is an average frequency for the entire pass.\n \n        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one\n        of three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It will be\n        configured such that the expected amplitude changes are\n        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth\n        (2BLo) will be configured such that the expected phase\n        changes can be accommodated while maintaining the best\n        possible loop SNR.\n \n        Open-Loop Receivers (OLR):  The OLR utilized a fixed first\n        Local Oscillator (LO) frequency and a tunable second LO\n        frequency to minimize phase noise and improve frequency\n        stability.  The OLR consisted of an RF-to-IF downconverter\n        located at the feed , an IF selection switch (IFS), and a\n        Radio Science Receiver (RSR).  The RF-IF downconverters\n        in the 70-m antennas were equipped for four IF channels:\n        S-RCP, S-LCP, X-RCP, and X-LCP.  The 34-m HEF stations\n        were equipped with a two-channel RF-IF: S-band and X-band.\n        The IFS switched the IF input among the antennas.\n \n \n      DSCC Transmitter Subsystem\n      --------------------------\n        The Transmitter Subsystem accepts the S-band frequency\n        exciter signal from the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem exciter\n        and amplifies it to the required transmit output level.  The\n        amplified signal is routed via the diplexer through the feed\n        horn to the antenna and then focused and beamed to the\n        spacecraft.\n \n        The Transmitter Subsystem power capabilities range from 18 kW\n        to 400 kW.  Power levels above 18 kW are available only at\n        70-m stations.\n \n \n      DSCC Tracking Subsystem\n      -----------------------\n        The Tracking Subsystem primary functions are to acquire and\n        maintain communications with the spacecraft and to generate\n        and format radiometric data containing Doppler and range.\n \n        The DSCC Tracking Subsystem (DTK) receives the carrier\n        signals and ranging spectra from the Receiver-Exciter\n        Subsystem.  The Doppler cycle counts are counted, formatted,\n        and transmitted to JPL in real time.  Ranging data are also\n        transmitted to JPL in real time.  Also contained in these\n        blocks is the AGC information from the Receiver-Exciter\n        Subsystem.  The Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT)\n        at JPL produces an Archival Tracking Data File (ATDF) which\n        contains Doppler and ranging data.\n \n        In addition, the Tracking Subsystem receives from the CMC\n        frequency predicts (used to compute frequency residuals and\n        noise estimates), receiver tuning predicts (used to tune the\n        closed-loop receivers), and uplink tuning predicts (used to\n        tune the exciter).  From the LMC, it receives configuration\n        and control directives as well as configuration and status\n        information on the transmitter, microwave, and frequency and\n        timing subsystems.\n \n        The Metric Data Assembly (MDA) controls all of the DTK\n        functions supporting the uplink and downlink activities.  The\n        MDA receives uplink predicts and controls the uplink tuning\n        by commanding the DCO.  The MDA also controls the Sequential\n        Ranging Assembly (SRA).  It formats the Doppler and range\n        measurements and provides them to the GCF for transmission to\n        NOCC.\n \n        The Sequential Ranging Assembly (SRA) measures the round trip\n        light time (RTLT) of a radio signal traveling from a ground\n        tracking station to a spacecraft and back.  From the RTLT,\n        phase, and Doppler data, the spacecraft range can be\n        determined.  A coded signal is modulated on an uplink carrier\n        and transmitted to the spacecraft where it is detected and\n        transponded back to the ground station.  As a result, the\n        signal received at the tracking station is delayed by its\n        round trip through space and shifted in frequency by the\n        Doppler effect due to the relative motion between the\n        spacecraft and the tracking station on Earth.\n \n \n      DSCC Frequency and Timing Subsystem\n      -----------------------------------\n        The Frequency and Timing Subsystem (FTS) provides all\n        frequency and timing references required by the other DSCC\n        subsystems.  It contains four frequency standards of which\n        one is prime and the other three are backups.  Selection of\n        the prime standard is done via the CMC.  Of these four\n        standards, two are hydrogen masers followed by clean-up loops\n        (CUL) and two are cesium standards.  These four standards all\n        feed the Coherent Reference Generator (CRG) which provides\n        the frequency references used by the rest of the complex.  It\n        also provides the frequency reference to the Master Clock\n        Assembly (MCA) which in turn provides time to the Time\n        Insertion and Distribution Assembly (TID) which provides UTC\n        and SIM-time to the complex.\n \n        JPL's ability to monitor the FTS at each DSCC is limited to\n        the MDA calculated Doppler pseudo-residuals, the Doppler\n        noise, the SSI, and to a system which uses the Global\n        Positioning System (GPS).  GPS receivers at each DSCC receive\n        a one-pulse-per-second pulse from the station's (hydrogen\n        maser referenced) FTS and a pulse from a GPS satellite at\n        scheduled times.  After compensating for the satellite signal\n        delay, the timing offset is reported to JPL where a database\n        is kept.  The clock offsets stored in the JPL database are\n        given in microseconds; each entry is a mean reading of\n        measurements from several GPS satellites and a time tag\n        associated with the mean reading.  The clock offsets provided\n        include those of SPC 10 relative to UTC (NIST), SPC 40\n        relative to SPC 10, etc.\n \n \n      Radio Science Receiver (RSR)\n      ----------------------------\n        A radio frequency (RF) spacecraft signal at S-band, X-band,\n        or Ka-band is captured by a receiving antenna on Earth, down\n        converted to an intermediate frequency (IF) near 300 MHz and\n        then fed via a distribution network to one input of an IF\n        Selector Switch (IFS).  The IFS allows each RSR to select any\n        of the available input signals for its RSR Digitizer (DIG).\n        Within the RSR the digitized signal is then passed to the\n        Digitial Down Converter (DDC), VME Data Processor (VDP), and\n        Data Processor (DP) [JPLD-16765].\n \n        \\       -----------      ------      -----      -----   -----\n         \\     | RF  TO IF |    |      |----|     |    |     | |     |\n          |----|    DOWN   |----|      |----|     |----| DIG | |  DP |\n         /     | CONVERTER |    |      |----|     |    |     | |     |\n        /       -----------     |  IF  |----| IFS |     -----   -----\n        ANTENNA               --| DIST |----|     |       |       |\n                300 MHz IF    --|      | .. |     |     -----   -----\n                FROM OTHER    --|      |----|     |    |     | |     |\n                 ANTENNAS     --|      |     -----     | DDC | | VDP |\n                                 ------                |     | |     |\n                                                        -----   -----\n                                                          |       |\n                                                           -------\n \n        In the DIG the IF signal is passed through a programmable\n        attenuator, adjusted to provide the proper level to the\n        Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).  The attenuated signal is\n        then passed through a Band Pass Filter (BPF) which selects a\n        frequency band in the range 265-375 MHz.  The filtered output\n        from the BPF is then mixed with a 256 MHz Local Oscillator\n        (LO), low pass filtered (LPF), and sampled by the ADC.  The\n        output of the ADC is a stream of 8-bit real samples at 256\n        Msamples/second (Msps).  DIG timing is derived from the\n        station FTS 5 MHz clock and 1 pulse per second (1PPS)\n        reference; the DIG generates a 256 MHz clock signal for later\n        processing.  The 1PPS signal marks the data sample taken at\n        the start of each second.\n \n        The DDC selects one 16 MHz subchannel from the possible 128\n        MHz bandwidth available from the DIG by using Finite Impulse\n        Response (FIR) filters with revolving banks of filter\n        coefficients.  The sample stream from the DIG is separated\n        into eight decimated streams, each of which is fed into two\n        sets of FIR filters.  One set of filters produces in-phase\n        (I) 8-bit data while the other produces quadrature-phase (Q)\n        8-bit data.  The center frequency of the desired 16 MHz\n        channel is adjustable in 1 MHz steps and is usually chosen to\n        be near the spacecraft carrier frequency.  After combining\n        the I and Q sample streams, the DDC feeds the samples to the\n        VDP.  The DDC also converts the 256 MHz data clock and 1PPS\n        signals into a msec time code, which is also passed to the\n        VDP.\n \n        The VDP contains a quadruply-redundant set of custom boards\n        which are controlled by a real-time control computer (RT).\n        Each set of boards comprises a numerically controlled\n        oscillator (NCO), a complex multiplier, a decimating FIR\n        filter, and a data packer.  The 16 Msps complex samples\n        from the DDC are digitally mixed with the NCO signal in the\n        complex multiplier.  The NCO phase and frequency are updated\n        every millisecond by the RT and are selected so that the\n        center frequency of the desired portion of the 16 MHz channel\n        is down-converted to 0 Hz.  The RT uses polynomials derived\n        from frequency predictions.  The output of the complex\n        multiplier is sent to the decimating FIR filter where its\n        bandwidth and sample rate are reduced (see table below).  The\n        decimating FIR filter also allows adjustment of the\n        sub-channel gain to take full advantage of the dynamic range\n        available in the hardware.  The data packer truncates samples\n        to 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bits by dropping the least significant\n        bits and packs them into 32-bit data words.  Q-samples are\n        packed into the first 16 bits of the word, and I-samples into\n        the least significant 16 bits (see below).  In 'narrow band'\n        operation all four sets of sets of custom boards can be\n        supported simultaneously.  In 'medium band' operation no more\n        than two channels can be supported simultaneously.  In\n        'wide band' operation, only one sub-channel can be recorded.\n \n        |============================================================|\n        |         RSR Sample Rates and Sample Sizes Supported        |\n        |================+=======+======+=================+==========|\n        |    Category    |  Rate | Size |    Data Rate    |Rec Length|\n        |                | (ksps)|(bits)|(bytes/s) (rec/s)|  (bytes) |\n        |================+=======+======+=========+=======+==========|\n        |Narrow Band (NB)|     1 |   8  |    2000 |    1  |    2000  |\n        |                |     2 |   8  |    4000 |    1  |    4000  |\n        |                |     4 |   8  |    8000 |    1  |    8000  |\n        |                |     8 |   8  |   16000 |    1  |   16000  |\n        |                |    16 |   8  |   32000 |    2  |   16000  |\n        |                |    25 |   8  |   50000 |    2  |   25000  |\n        |                |    50 |   8  |  100000 |    4  |   25000  |\n        |                |   100 |   8  |  200000 |   10  |   20000  |\n        |                |     1 |  16  |    4000 |    1  |    4000  |\n        |                |     2 |  16  |    8000 |    1  |    8000  |\n        |                |     4 |  16  |   16000 |    1  |   16000  |\n        |                |     8 |  16  |   32000 |    2  |   16000  |\n        |                |    16 |  16  |   64000 |    4  |   16000  |\n        |                |    25 |  16  |  100000 |    4  |   25000  |\n        |                |    50 |  16  |  200000 |   10  |   20000  |\n        |                |   100 |  16  |  400000 |   20  |   20000  |\n        |Medium Band (MB)|   250 |   1  |   62500 |    5  |   12500  |\n        |                |   500 |   1  |  125000 |    5  |   25000  |\n        |                |  1000 |   1  |  250000 |   10  |   25000  |\n        |                |  2000 |   1  |  500000 |   20  |   25000  |\n        |                |  4000 |   1  | 1000000 |   40  |   25000  |\n        |                |   250 |   2  |  125000 |    5  |   25000  |\n        |                |   500 |   2  |  250000 |   10  |   25000  |\n        |                |  1000 |   2  |  500000 |   20  |   25000  |\n        |                |  2000 |   2  | 1000000 |   40  |   25000  |\n        |                |  4000 |   2  | 2000000 |  100  |   20000  |\n        |                |   250 |   4  |  250000 |   10  |   25000  |\n        |                |   500 |   4  |  500000 |   20  |   25000  |\n        |                |  1000 |   4  | 1000000 |   40  |   25000  |\n        |                |  2000 |   4  | 2000000 |  100  |   20000  |\n        |                |   250 |   8  |  500000 |   20  |   25000  |\n        |                |   500 |   8  | 1000000 |   40  |   25000  |\n        |                |  1000 |   8  | 2000000 |  100  |   20000  |\n        |Wide Band (WB)  |  8000 |   1  | 2000000 |  100  |   20000  |\n        |                | 16000 |   1  | 4000000 |  200  |   20000  |\n        |                |  8000 |   2  | 4000000 |  200  |   20000  |\n        |============================================================|\n \n        |============================================================|\n        |                        Sample Packing                      |\n        |=================+==========================================|\n        | Bits per Sample |  Contents of 32-bit Packed Data Register |\n        |=================+==========================================|\n        |         16      |     (Q1),(I1)                            |\n        |          8      |     (Q2,Q1),(I2,I1)                      |\n        |          4      |     (Q4,Q3,Q2,Q1),(I4,I3,I2,I1)          |\n        |          2      |     (Q8,Q7,...Q1),(I8,I7,...I1)          |\n        |          1      |     (Q16,Q15,...Q1),(I16,I15,...I1)      |\n        |============================================================|\n \n        Once per second the RT sends the accumulated data records from\n        each sub-channel to the Data Processor (DP) over a 100 Mbit/s\n        ethernet connection.  In addition to the samples, each data\n        record includes header information such as time tags and NCO\n        frequency and phase that are necessary for analysis.

Using\n          these points, the RT computes expected sky frequencies at\n          the beginning, middle, and end of each one second time\n          interval. Based on the local oscillator frequencies\n          selected and any offsets entered, the RT computes the\n          coefficients of a frequency polynomial fitted to the DDC\n          channel frequencies at these three times.  The RT also\n          computes a phase polynomial by integrating the frequency\n          polynomial and matching phases at the one second\n          boundaries.\n \n          The phase and frequency of the VDP NCO's are computed every\n          millisecond (000-999) from the polynomial coefficients as\n          follows:\n \n              nco_phase(msec) = phase_coef_1 +\n                                phase_coef_2 * (msec/1000) +\n                                phase_coef_3 * (msec/1000)**2 +\n                                phase_coef_4 * (msec/1000)**3\n \n              nco_freq(msec)  = freq_coef_1 +\n                                freq_coef_2 * ((msec + 0.5)/1000) +\n                                freq_coef_3 * ((msec + 0.5)/1000)**2\n \n \n          The sky frequency may be reconstructed using\n \n                  sky_freq = RF_to_IF_LO +\n                             DDC_LO -\n                             nco_freq +\n                             reside_freq\n \n            where  RF_to_IF_LO  is the down conversion from the\n                                microwave frequency to IF (bytes\n                                42-43 in the data record header)\n                   DDC_LO       is the down-conversion applied in the\n                                DIG and DDC (bytes 40-41 in the data\n                                record header)\n                   Resid_Freq   is the frequency of the signal in the\n                                VDP output\n \n \n    Detectors - DSN\n    ===============\n      Nominal carrier tracking loop threshold noise bandwidth at\n      X-band is 10 Hz.  Coherent (two-way) closed-loop system\n      stability is shown in the table below:\n \n            integration time            Doppler uncertainty\n                 (secs)               (one sigma, microns/sec)\n                 ------               ------------------------\n                    10                            50\n                    60                            20\n                  1000                             4\n \n      For the open-loop subsystem, signal detection is done in\n      software.\n \n \n    Calibration - DSN\n    =================\n      Calibrations of hardware systems are carried out periodically\n      by DSN personnel; these ensure that systems operate at required\n      performance levels -- for example, that antenna patterns,\n      receiver gain, propagation delays, and Doppler uncertainties\n      meet specifications.  No information on specific calibration\n      activities is available.  Nominal performance specifications\n      are shown in the tables above.  Additional information may be\n      available in [DSN810-5].\n \n      Prior to each tracking pass, station operators perform a series\n      of calibrations to ensure that systems meet specifications for\n      that operational period.  Included in these calibrations is\n      measurement of receiver system temperature in the configuration\n      to be employed during the pass.  Results of these calibrations\n      are recorded in (hard copy) Controller's Logs for each pass.\n \n      The nominal procedure for initializing open-loop receiver\n      attenuator settings is described below.  In cases where widely\n      varying signal levels are expected, the procedure may be\n      modified in advance or real-time adjustments may be made to\n      attenuator settings.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations - DSN\n    ================================\n      The DSN is a complex and dynamic 'instrument.' Its performance\n      for Radio Science depends on a number of factors from equipment\n      configuration to meteorological conditions.  No specific\n      information on 'operational considerations' can be given here.\n \n \n    Operational Modes - DSN\n    =======================\n \n      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem\n      ---------------------------------\n        Pointing of DSCC antennas may be carried out in several ways.\n        For details see the subsection 'DSCC Antenna Mechanical\n        Subsystem' in the 'Subsystem' section.  Binary pointing is\n        the preferred mode for tracking spacecraft; pointing\n        predicts are provided, and the antenna simply follows those.\n        With CONSCAN, the antenna scans conically about the optimum\n        pointing direction, using closed-loop receiver signal\n        strength estimates as feedback.  In planetary mode, the\n        system interpolates from three (slowly changing) RA-DEC\n        target coordinates; this is 'blind' pointing since there is\n        no feedback from a detected signal.  In sidereal mode, the\n        antenna tracks a fixed point on the celestial sphere.  In\n        'precision' mode, the antenna pointing is adjusted using an\n        optical feedback system.  It is possible on most antennas to\n        freeze z-axis motion of the subreflector to minimize phase\n        changes in the received signal.\n \n \n      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem\n      -------------------------------\n        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and\n        the feed horns on all antennas may be configured so\n        that it is out of the received signal path in order to\n        improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver system.\n        This is known as the 'listen-only' or 'bypass' mode.\n \n \n      Closed-Loop Receiver AGC Loop\n      -----------------------------\n        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of\n        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  Ordinarily it is\n        configured so that expected signal amplitude changes are\n        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth is\n        ordinarily configured so that expected phase changes can be\n        accommodated while maintaining the best possible loop SNR.\n \n \n      Coherent vs. Non-Coherent Operation\n      -----------------------------------\n        The frequency of the signal transmitted from the spacecraft\n        can generally be controlled in two ways -- by locking to a\n        signal received from a ground station or by locking to an\n        on-board oscillator.  These are known as the coherent (or\n        'two-way') and non-coherent ('one-way') modes, respectively.\n        Mode selection is made at the spacecraft, based on commands\n        received from the ground.  When operating in the coherent\n        mode, the transponder carrier frequency is derived from the\n        received uplink carrier frequency with a 'turn-around ratio'\n        typically of 880/749.  In the non-coherent mode, the\n        downlink carrier frequency is derived from the spacecraft\n        on-board crystal-controlled oscillator.  Either closed-loop\n        or open-loop receivers (or both) can be used with either\n        spacecraft frequency reference mode.  Closed-loop reception\n        in two-way mode is usually preferred for routine tracking.\n        Occasionally the spacecraft operates coherently while two\n        ground stations receive the 'downlink' signal; this is\n        sometimes known as the 'three-way' mode.\n \n \n    Location - DSN\n    ==============\n      Station locations are documented in [DSN810-005-301H].  Geocentric\n      coordinates are summarized here.

Effects of Radiation (CRaTER)","display_description":"Abstract:\n  =========\n \n    The investigation hardware consists of a single, integrated sensor\n    and electronics box with simple electronic and mechanical interfaces\n    to the LRO spacecraft. The CRaTER sensor front-end design is based on\n    standard stacked-detector, cosmic ray telescope systems that have been\n    flown for decades, using detectors developed for other NASA flight\n    programs. The analog electronics design is virtually identical to the\n    robust and flight-proven design of the NASA/POLAR Imaging Proton\n    Spectrometer that has been operating flawlessly on orbit since 1996.\n    The digital processing unit is a simple and straightforward design\n    also based on similar instruments with excellent spaceflight heritage.\n    No new technology developments or supporting research are required for\n    the final design, fabrication, and operation of this instrument..\n \n    The text of this instrument description has been abstracted from the\n    instrument paper [CHINETAL2007] and from a preliminary draft of the\n    CRaTER Instrument Calibration Plan [KASPER2007].\n \n  Scientific Objectives:\n  ======================\n \n    The Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) is\n    designed to answer key questions to enable future human exploration of\n    the Solar System, and to address one of the prime objectives of LRO.\n    Specifically, CRaTER addresses an objective required by NASA's\n    Exploration Initiative to safely return humans to the Moon; CRaTER is\n    designed to achieve characterization of the global lunar radiation\n    environment and its biological impacts and potential mitigation, as\n    well as investigation of shielding capabilities and validation of other\n    deep space radiation mitigation strategies involving materials. CRaTER\n    will fill knowledge gaps regarding radiation effects, provide\n    fundamental progress in knowledge of the Moon's radiation environment,\n    and provide specific path-finding benefits for future planned human\n    exploration. CRaTER's primary measurement goal is to measure directly\n    the linear energy transfer (LET) spectra caused by space radiation\n    penetrating shielding material. Such LET spectra are a missing link,\n    currently derived by models which require experimental measurements to\n    provide ground truth. CRaTER will provide this essential information\n    about the lunar radiation environment.\n \n    LET is defined as the mean energy absorbed locally, per unit path\n    length, when an energetic particle traverses material. A LET\n    spectrometer measures the amount of energy deposited in a detector of\n    known thickness and material property when an energetic particle passes\n    through it, usually without stopping. LET measurements behind various\n    thicknesses and types of material are of great importance to spacecraft\n    engineers and radiation health specialists. Such measurements are\n    especially important to modelers who study the impacts of the\n    penetrating radiation; LET is one of the most important inputs for\n    predictive models of human health risks and radiation effects in\n    electronic devices. While LET spectrometers do not necessarily resolve\n    particle mass, LET measurements do include all the species, with the\n    possible exception of neutrons, that are relevant to the energy\n    deposited behind a known amount of spacecraft shielding. A LET\n    spectrometer essentially provides the key direct measurement needed to\n    bridge the gap between well measured cosmic ray intensities (that will\n    be available from other spacecraft) and specific energy deposition\n    behind shielding materials, exploration-enabling knowledge vital to the\n    safety of humans working in the harsh space radiation environment.\n    Accordingly, CRaTER is designed to measure this important quantity and\n    thereby provide critical closure between measurements, theory, and\n    modeling.\n \n    CRaTER will measure LET spectra produced by incident galactic cosmic\n    rays (GCRs) and solar energetic protons (SEPs). GCRs and SEPs with\n    energies >10 MeV have sufficient energy to penetrate even moderate\n    shielding. When they interact with matter, they leave behind energy,\n    damaging the human tissue and electronic parts they pass through. GCRs\n    and SEPs possess both short and long timescale variations (see Fig.\n    10), some of which are predictable and others that are not presently\n    predictable. GCRs are a slowly-varying and uniform source of cosmic\n    radiation that bathes the solar system. SEPs are episodic and rare, but\n    come in extreme bursts associated with intense solar magnetic activity.\n    Both GCRs and SEPs pose serious risks to humans venturing above the\n    relative safety of low-Earth orbit and the Earths powerful magnetic\n    shield; areas including the Moon and the interplanetary space between\n    Earth and Mars may be dangerous to humans.\n \n    In order to achieve the LRO radiation mission requirement, CRaTER is\n    designed to return the following required data products:\n \n    * Measure and characterize that aspect of the deep space radiation\n    environment, LET spectra of galactic and solar cosmic rays\n    (particularly above 10 MeV), most critically important to the\n    engineering and modeling communities to assure safe, long-term, human\n    presence in space.\n \n    * Investigate the effects of shielding by measuring LET spectra behind\n    different amounts and types of areal density, including\n    tissue-equivalent plastic.\n \n    The CRaTER measurement concept is shown in the see-thru telescope\n    drawing below (Fig. 11). The investigation hardware consists of a\n    single, integrated telescope and electronics box with straightforward\n    electronic and mechanical interfaces to the spacecraft. The\n    zenith-nadir viewing telescope employs a stack of three pairs of\n    detectors embedded within aluminum structure and tissue-equivalent\n    plastic (TEP) to establish the LET spectra of cosmic radiation relevant\n    for human health and electronics part concerns.\n \n    Primary GCRs and SEPs enter the telescope through the zenith,\n    deep-space entrance, depositing energy in the telescope stack through\n    ionizing radiation and producing secondary particles through nuclear\n    interactions. The primary and secondary particles interact with one or\n    more of the six detectors through the stack: the thin (thick) detectors\n    are optimized for high (low) LET interactions. Events with sufficient\n    energy deposition in a detector cross a trigger threshold. Digital\n    logic then compares multi-detection coincidences with predefined event\n    masks to identify desirable events. Pulse height analysis is performed\n    on every detector to measure LET at each point in the stack.\n \n    The measurement team will use observations taken during the mission to\n    construct LET spectra behind the different amounts of material,\n    including TEP, as a function of particle environment (GCR vs. SEP;\n    foreshock vs. magnetotail vs. solar wind; etc.). The team will also\n    test models of radiation effects and shielding by verifying/validating\n    deterministic models.\n \n    Model predictions of energy transport of incident GCR and SEP spectra\n    (available contemporaneously on other missions) through the CRaTER\n    instrument will be compared to the measured LET spectra. Thus, CRaTER\n    will provide not only direct measurements of LET in the lunar\n    environment, but will also better constrain radiation effects models\n    that are being used to assess the effects of other radiation\n    environments, including in interplanetary space and at Mars.\n \n  Calibration:\n  ============\n \n    The calibration of the CRaTER Flight Models is based on lessons learned\n    from experiences with the Engineering Model: the relationship between\n    the value returned by the detectors and the original energy deposited is\n    essentially linear. Gains and offsets for each detector are determined\n    with high precision by calibrating the instrument with a beam of high\n    energy protons produced by the Northeast Proton Therapy Center (NPTC) of\n    Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston. A 300 MeV proton beam at\n    MGH is degraded in energy using sheets of plastic until a beam is produced\n    with large energy dispersion and a peak energy tuned to the response of\n    a pair of thin and thick CRaTER detectors. The dispersed beam produces\n    a characteristic track in energy deposition in the pair of detectors.\n    The gains and offsets for each of the detectors is then determined by\n    iteratively varying the free parameters of the instrument response until\n    the measurements match the predictions of GEANT numerical simulations\n    of the energy loss.\n \n \n  Operational Modes:\n  ===========================\n \n    The CRaTER instrument has only two modes: powered up and powered down.\n    There are no operational constraints on these modes. In particular,\n    CRaTER can be powered up during the cruise phase of the mission, and\n    will return scientifically useful data.\n \n  Sensors:\n  ==========\n \n    The investigation hardware consists of a single, integrated sensor and\n    electronics box with simple electronic and mechanical interfaces to the\n    LRO spacecraft. The CRaTER sensor front-end design is based on standard\n    stacked-detector, cosmic ray telescope systems that have been flown for\n    decades, using detectors developed for other NASA flight programs. The\n    analog electronics design is virtually identical to the robust and flight-\n    proven design of the NASA/POLAR Imaging Proton Spectrometer that has been\n    operating flawlessly on orbit since 1996. The digital processing unit is\n    a simple and straightforward design also based on similar instruments\n    with excellent spaceflight heritage. No new technology developments or\n    supporting research are required for the final design, fabrication, and\n    operation of this instrument.\n \n \n    The CRaTER telescope consists of six ion-implanted silicon detectors,\n    mounted on detector boards, and separated by pieces of tissue-\n    equivalent plastic, hereinafter referred to as TEP. All six of the\n    silicon detectors are 2 cm in diameter. Detectors 1, 3, and 5 are 140m\n    thick; the others are 1000m thick. TEP (such as A-150 manufactured by\n    Standard Imaging) simulates soft body tissue (muscle) and has been used\n    for both ground-based as well as space-based (i.e., Space Station)\n    experiments.\n \n    Solid-state detectors use semi-conducting crystals (in CRaTERs case,\n    silicon) with n-type (electron-rich, electron conducting) and p-type\n    (electron-deficient, hole conducting) regions.\n \n    When a reversed bias voltage is applied across the junction, the\n    un-bonded electrons in the semiconductor are pushed away from the\n    voltage source, while the holes are pulled towards it. This leaves a\n    neutral area void of charge and current at the junction of the sectors,\n    called the depletion region. As incoming radiation (e.g., a solar\n    proton or cosmic ray particle) collides with the depletion region,\n    electron-hole pairs are formed in the material (where a once bonded\n    electron is freed from its atom, leaving a hole). The electron and the\n    hole respond to the applied voltage, and a small current is created.\n    This current can be detected and later analyzed.\n \n    A cold environment greatly reduces the transmission of thermal\n    signals. In addition, the solid state of the semiconducting material\n    makes it easier to detect those signals attributable to freed\n    electrons.\n \n    Tissue equivalent plastic (or TEP) is a plastic recipe designed to\n    simulate human tissue. It includes hydrogen and nitrogen\n    percentages-by-composition that are similar to that found in human skin\n    and muscle. Scientists can use the atomic-level effects that radiation\n    has on the TEP to deduce what sort of similar effects may occur in\n    humans.\n \n  Electronics:\n  ============\n \n    The front-end analog electronics utilize charge amplifiers to collect\n    signals from the six silicon detectors, amplify, and pulse-shape them\n    for high-level processing. The backend digital electronics receives the\n    six signals converts them in parallel to 12-bit digital quantities and,\n    using a programmable coincidence mask, filters out the events of\n    interest. Those events are then packed into standard CCSDS data packets\n    and forwarded to the spacecraft data system for storage and eventual\n    telemetry to the ground. A field programmable logic array contains all\n    of the digital circuitry that receives commands from the spacecraft and\n    handles telemetry packet formatting as well as collecting useful\n    secondary science and analog housekeeping information. There is no\n    processor or software within the instrument.\n \n    The maximum event rate that the instrument can telemeter is limited to\n    1200 events/second, enforced separately for every 1 second interval;\n    excess events are discarded. The instrument has an internal deadtime of\n    12 microseconds. Events are time-tagged to an accuracy of 1 second.","is_prime":true,"tools":[]},{"tags":["Radio"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:dlre.lro","display_name":"Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE)","display_description":"Instrument Overview\n===================\n \nThe Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment is in most respects a copy\nof the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) instrument on Mars Reconnaissance\nOrbiter.

(2005)\n    [GLADSTONEETAL2005] and Gladstone et al. (2008) [GLADSTONEETAL2008].\n \n    The Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP) instrument is one of the remote\n    sensing instruments on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft\n    that will acquire orbital observations of the lunar surface during a one\n    year primary mapping phase.  LRO is scheduled to launch in April 2009 and\n    arrive at the Moon approximately four days later.  Lunar orbit insertion\n    will place the spacecraft into a quasi-frozen 30 x 216 kilometer near-\n    polar orbit suitable for the commissioning phase, which will last\n    approximately 60 days.  At the end of commissioning, final orbit maneuvers\n    will insert LRO into the nominal mission orbit, a mean 50 kilometer polar\n    orbit in which LRO will remain for at least one year.\n \n    LAMP is a far ultraviolet spectrograph provided by the Southwest Research\n    Institute (SwRI).  LAMP's nadir observing geometry on the LRO spacecraft\n    will translate its 0.3 x 6 degree field of view into a footprint of 0.26 x\n    5.2 kilometers on the lunar surface from an altitude of 50 kilometers.\n    LAMP will measure the signal reflected from the nightside lunar surface\n    and Permanently Shaded Regions (PSRs) using Lyman-alpha sky-glow and UV\n    starlight as light sources.  LAMP data will nominally be taken entirely in\n    time-tagged mode, allowing mapping at a variety of resolutions.\n    Reflectance data will yield albedo maps of PSRs, spectra of PSRs will\n    yield exposed water frost abundances, and atmospheric spectra will yield\n    species abundances and variability.\n \n    The LAMP instrument is closely based on the Pluto Alice (P-Alice)\n    instrument design (Stern et al. 2005 [STERNETAL2005]; Slater et al. 2005\n    [SLATERETAL2005]; Stern et al. 2008 [STERNETAL2008]), which is, in turn,\n    based largely on the Rosetta Alice (R-Alice) instrument design (Stern et\n    al. 1998 [STERNETAL1998]; Slater et al. 2001 [SLATERETAL2001]), with only\n    relatively minor changes in baffling, software, and the addition of a\n    lunar terminator sensor.\n \n    SPECIFICATIONS\n    --------------\n \n    NAME:                    LAMP\n    DESCRIPTION:             Ultraviolet Mapping Spectrograph\n    PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:  Randy Gladstone, SwRI\n    WAVELENGTH RANGE:        57.5 - 196.5 nm (first order) [Note 1]\n    FIELD OF VIEW:           (0.31 +/- 0.01) X (6.00 +/- 0.01) deg [Note 1]\n    ANGULAR RESOLUTION:      0.29 +/- 0.03 deg per spatial pixel [Note 1]\n    WAVELENGTH RESOLUTION:   0.182 +/- 0.001 nm [Note 1]\n \n    Note 1:  Measured performance\n \n \n  SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES\n  =====================\n    The primary scientific objectives of LAMP are:\n \n    1) To generate albedo maps of all PSRs\n \n    2) To develop exposed water-frost concentration maps of the lunar polar\n    regions\n \n \n  CALIBRATION\n  ===========\n    Ground radiometric characterization and absolute calibration of the\n    instrument was performed at SwRI's UV space instrument calibration\n    facility located in SwRI's Space Science and Engineering Division.  The\n    radiometric vacuum chamber consists of a 4-inch diameter off-axis\n    parabolic collimator mirror that is fed by a differentially pumped hollow-\n    cathode UV light source and an Acton Research Corporation VM-502 vacuum\n    monochromator.  A variable slit and pinhole assembly at the output of the\n    monochromator (and situated at the focus of the collimator mirror) allowed\n    for point source illumination of the LAMP airglow input apertures.\n    Radiometric characterization tests included the detector dark count rate,\n    wavelength calibration, spectral and spatial point spread function (PSF)\n    versus wavelength, filled slit spectral resolution, off-axis stray light\n    attenuation, and absolute effective area measurements as a function of\n    wavelength.  See Gladstone et al. (2008) for further details.\n \n    During the commissioning phase, the LAMP instrument will be commanded to\n    perform five different calibration activities: (1) raster scan star\n    calibrations; (2) stare star calibrations; (3) dark count rate\n    calibrations; (4) flat field calibrations; and (5) stray light\n    calibration.  In addition to these calibration activities, LAMP will\n    perform instrument characterizations such as high voltage (HV)\n    discriminator setting tests as well as periodic decontamination using\n    internal heaters.\n \n    During the nominal mission phase, instrument calibrations will be\n    performed in conjunction with the monthly station-keeping maneuvers.  For\n    LAMP these will include all five types mentioned above for the\n    commissioning phase.\n \n \n  OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n  ==========================\n    The LAMP instrument will collect measurement data only over the night\n    portion of the orbit until minimum mission objectives are satisfied.\n    Nominally, LAMP will operate in pixel list (time-tagged photon)\n    acquisition mode.  When LRO crosses the lunar terminator (day to night),\n    the high voltage (HV) will be ramped up to full operating level.  The\n    ramp-up is triggered by the Lunar Terminator Sensor (LTS).  Prior to\n    crossing the terminator again (night to day), the HV will be ramped down\n    to a safe level by the LTS.  While LAMP is operating over the night\n    portion of the orbit, the instrument will generate measurement data at a\n    rate of about 30 kbps. The spacecraft will collect and store the data on\n    the flight recorder.  The spacecraft will store about 113 minutes' worth\n    (one orbit's worth) of measurement data in each data file. After minimum\n    mission objectives have been completed, LAMP will operate over the full\n    orbit.  A small pin-hole in the aperture door of LAMP allows the\n    instrument to operate over the entire orbit.\n \n    The LAMP Science Operations Center (SOC) will generate any required\n    command activity request.  Activity requests are used to request special\n    operations or update command sequences.  During nominal operations, the\n    LTS will be used to trigger the high-to-low and low-to-high voltage\n    transitions.  As a contingency, the Mission Operations Team (MOT) will\n    have the ability to generate the daily command loads that include commands\n    to trigger the voltage transitions based on the predicted terminator-\n    crossing times generated by the Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF).  This\n    procedure will be used, if needed, as a backup to the LTS.\n \n    LAMP operations also involve a number of constraints to avoid damage to\n    the instrument.  These include keeping the LAMP boresight pointed away\n    from the Sun and other designated UV-bright stars, as well as making sure\n    that the instrument is in a proper state prior to conducting certain\n    operations.\n \n \n  DETECTORS\n  =========\n    The 2-D imaging photon-counting detector located in the spectrograph\n    section of the instrument utilizes a microchannel plate (MCP) Z-stack that\n    feeds the double-delay line (DDL) readout array.  The input surface of the\n    Z-stack is coated with an opaque photocathode of CsI.  The detector body\n    tube is a custom design made of a lightweight brazed alumina-Kovar\n    structure that is welded to a housing that supports the DDL anode array.\n \n    To capture the entire 57.5-196.5 nm passband and 6 degree spatial field of\n    view (FOV), the size of the detector's active area is 35 mm (in the\n    dispersion direction) by 20 mm (in the spatial dimension), with a pixel\n    format of 1024 x 32 pixels.  The 6 degree slit-height is imaged onto the\n    central 22 of the detector's 32 spatial channels; the remaining spatial\n    channels are used for dark count monitoring.  LAMP's pixel format allows\n    Nyquist sampling with a spectral resolution of 0.36 nm, and a spatial\n    resolution of ~0.6 degree.\n \n    The MCP Z-stack is composed of three 80:1 length-to-diameter MCPs that are\n    cylindrically curved with a radius of curvature of 75 mm to match the\n    Rowland-circle for optimum focus.  The total Z-stack resistance is ~300\n    MOhms. The MCPs are rectangular in format (46 x 30 mm^2), with 12 um\n    diameter pores. Above the MCP Z-stack is a repeller grid that is biased\n    ~900 V more negative than the top of the MCP Z-stack.  This repeller grid\n    reflects electrons liberated in the interstitial regions of the MCP back\n    down to the MCP input surface to enhance the detector quantum efficiency.\n    The MCP Z-stack requires a high voltage bias of ~-3 kV; an additional -600\n    V is required between the MCP Z-stack output and the anode array (the\n    anode array is referenced to ground).  The lab-measured dark count rate of\n    the flight MCP stack is quite low and stable--less than 6 Hz over the\n    entire MCP active area.  The on-orbit dark count rate will likely be\n    considerably larger, however, (probably ~20 Hz or so) due to the energetic\n    particle environment in space.\n \n \n  ELECTRONICS\n  ===========\n    The detector electronics amplify and convert the detected output pulses\n    from the MCP Z-stack to pixel address locations.  Only those analog pulses\n    output from the MCP that have amplitudes above a set threshold level are\n    processed and converted to pixel address locations.  For each detected and\n    processed event, a 10-bit X (spectral) address and a 5-bit Y (spatial)\n    address are generated by the detector electronics and sent to the LAMP\n    command and data handling (C&DH) electronics for data storage and\n    manipulation.  In addition to the pixel address words, the detector\n    electronics also digitizes the analog amplitude of the detected event\n    output by the preamplifiers and sends this datum to the C&DH electronics.\n    Histogramming of this 'pulse-height' information creates a pulse-height\n    distribution used to monitor the health and status of the detector during\n    operation.  An analog count rate signal is output from the detector\n    electronics to the C&DH to allow monitoring and recording of the detector\n    total array count rate.  This count rate is updated once per second and is\n    included in the LAMP housekeeping data.  A built-in 'stim-pulser' is\n    included in the electronics that stimulates photon events at two pixel\n    locations on the array.  This pulser can be turned on and off by command\n    and allows testing of the entire detector and C&DH electronics signal path\n    without having to power on the detector high-voltage power supplies\n    (HVPSs) or put light on the detector.\n \n    The LAMP instrument support electronics include the low-voltage power\n    supply (LVPS) and actuator electronics, the C&DH electronics, the optics\n    decontamination heater system, and the redundant detector HVPSs.  All of\n    these subsystems are controlled by a radiation-hardened version of the\n    Intel 8052 microprocessor with 32 kB of fuse programmable PROM, 128 kB of\n    EEPROM, 32 kB of SRAM, and 128 kB of acquisition memory.  The C&DH\n    electronics are contained on four circuit boards located just behind the\n    detector electronics.\n \n \n  OPTICS\n  ======\n    The LAMP spectrograph comprises a telescope and Rowland-circle\n    spectrograph. LAMP has a single 40 x 40 mm^2 entrance aperture that feeds\n    light to the telescope section of the instrument.  Entering light is\n    collected and focused by an f/3 off-axis paraboloidal (OAP) primary mirror\n    at the back end of the telescope section onto the instrument's entrance\n    slit.  After passing through the entrance slit, the light falls onto a\n    toroidal holographic diffraction grating, which disperses the light onto\n    the DDL MCP detector.\n \n    The OAP mirror and diffraction grating are constructed from monolithic\n    pieces of aluminum, coated with electroless nickel and polished using low-\n    scatter polishing techniques.  The aluminum optics, in conjunction with\n    the aluminum housing, form an athermal optical design.  Both the OAP\n    mirror and the grating are overcoated with sputtered Al/MgF2 for optimum\n    reflectivity within LAMP's spectral passband.  Besides using low-scatter\n    optics, additional control of internal stray light is achieved using\n    internal baffle vanes within both the telescope and spectrograph sections\n    of the housing, a holographic diffraction grating that has low scatter and\n    near-zero line ghost problems, and an internal housing with alodyned\n    aluminum surfaces.  In addition, the zero order baffle is treated with a\n    nickel-phosphorus (Ni-P) black coating with very low surface reflectance\n    at EUV/FUV wavelengths.\n \n \n  OPERATIONAL MODES\n  =================\n    LAMP has two detector data collection modes: i) pixel list mode; and ii)\n    histogram mode.  However, because of its nature and its mission, nearly\n    all the LAMP data will be obtained in pixel list mode (exceptions will be\n    made for flat-field and pulse-height distribution measurements).  The\n    science data from the detector are collected in the dual port acquisition\n    memory that consists of two separate 32K x 16-bit memory channels.  In\n    pixel list mode each memory channel can hold up to 32K detector and/or\n    time-hack events, where each detector event consists of a 16-bit word--an\n    X-position word 10 bits in length, a Y-position word 5 bits in length, and\n    a single status bit that distinguishes between a time-hack word and a\n    detector event word.  A time-hack word includes a single status bit plus\n    15 bits that encode the instrument time.  When 32K detector address and\n    time-hack events have accumulated in one of the two acquisition memories,\n    that acquisition memory stops accumulating event data and begins to read\n    the data out to a parallel-to-serial converter and a low-voltage\n    differential signaling (LVDS) interface to the spacecraft on-board memory.\n    At the same time that this LVDS readout is taking place, the other side of\n    the dual acquisition memory continues to collect detector and time-hack\n    data until it fills up, whereupon it reads out to the LVDS interface to\n    the spacecraft memory, while the first acquisition memory takes over\n    collecting detector and time-hack data.  This back-and-forth data\n    collection flow between both acquisition memories is called 'ping-pong'\n    acquisition--it allows contiguous readout of detector event data as long\n    as the event data rate does not exceed the rate at which the data can be\n    read out of memory to the LVDS interface.  The 'ping-pong' acquisition\n    process is controlled using logic encoded in one of two floating-point\n    gate arrays (FPGAs) within the C&DH electronics.\n \n    LAMP also includes a flight software mechanism to filter out events from\n    selected areas of the detector.  This may be used to suppress 'hot' pixels\n    that could develop in the detector, especially in the pixel list mode,\n    which might otherwise consume a large fraction of the available\n    acquisition memory. This filtering is performed before events are\n    processed in either histogram or pixel list mode.  The system defines up\n    to 8 rectangular regions of 32 X 4 pixels that suppress any events from\n    the selected regions from being processed.  Configuration parameters allow\n    for the placement of these filtered areas at any desired positions within\n    the detector area.\n \n \n  MEASURED PARAMETERS\n  ===================\n    See the discussion above regarding Operational Modes.","tools":[]},{"tags":["Plasma Reader"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lend.lro","display_name":"Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND)","display_description":"Instrument Overview\n  ===================\n    The Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector, LEND, was designed and\n    built by P.I. Igor Mitrofanov at the Russian Space Institute for\n    incorporation into NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) as\n    a large orbital neutron telescope for mapping the Moon's neutron\n    albedo. LEND is the follow-on instrument from the High Energy\n    Neutron Detector (HEND) onboard Mars Odyssey, although LEND\n    incorporates a set of collimated detectors to improve spatial\n    resolution. The methods and procedures of LEND data processing\n    and analysis are based on existing procedures that have been\n    developed for analysis of HEND data.\n \n    The LEND instrument is based on the registration of secondary\n    neutrons from the Moon, which are created in the upper 1-2 meters\n    of lunar regolith which is irradiated by cosmic rays. Neutrons\n    of high energy are born in the regolith and then slowed down and\n    absorbed by nuclei of the major elements in the regolith through\n    inelastic scattering and capture. The neutron\n    flux coming out of the regolith depends upon the composition of\n    the regolith, and is strongly affected by the presence of hydrogen\n    or its compounds. When colliding with a hydrogen nucleus, a\n    neutron losses half of its energy which leads to fast\n    thermalization, thus to a significant increase of the flux of\n    thermal neutrons and reduction in the flux of the epithermal\n    neutrons. The orbital flux of epithermal neutrons depeds upon\n    the hydrogen content of the regolith.\n \n    Usage of different methods of neutron spectrometry allows us to\n    obtain the average hydrogen or water ice content along with\n    estimates of thickness of the ice cover due to comparison of\n    counting rates of neutrons having different energies. The flux of\n    epithermal neutrons and the flux of fast neutrons depend upon the\n    thickness of water ice on the Lunar surface.\n \n    LEND has eight 3He sensors for detecting thermal and epithermal\n    neutrons. Four of the 3He sensors un-collimated and four are\n    collimated. The external sensors STN1-3 (Sensor Thermal Neutrons)\n    and SETN (Sensor EpiThermal Neutrons) are the un-collimated\n    sensors that detect thermal and epithermal neutrons. STN-3 and\n    SETN both have open fields of view. The combination of these two\n    sensors will allow the measurement of local density of thermal and\n    epithermal neutrons around the spacecraft. STN 1 and 2 are located\n    near the midpoint of the instrument and have the thick mass of the\n    collimation module just between them. For sensors on the +X and -X\n    sides, the collimation material absorbs all external particles\n    coming from directions -X and +X, respectively. The velocity\n    vector of LRO will correspond to one of these directions:\n    therefore, sensors STN 1 and 2 will detect neutrons with\n    velocities (Vn + Vorb) and (Vn - Vorb), respectively, and will\n    operate as a Doppler filter to separate the flux of external\n    neutrons from the Moon from the local spacecraft background. The\n    full set of four sensors, SETN and STN 1-3, will provide the data\n    to characterize the neutron component of lunar radiation\n    background at the altitude of LRO separately from the neutron\n    component of local background produced by LRO itself.\n \n    The collimated sensors of epithermal neutrons, CSETN1-4, are also\n    3He counters, that are installed inside the collimating module,\n    which effectively absorbs external neutrons outside of instrument\n    Field of View. Absorbing neutrons is very difficult; one of the\n    best absorbing materials is 10B, and its absorption efficiency\n    becomes much higher when neutrons are slower. The LEND\n    collimators have external layers of polyethylene for moderation\n    of impacting neutrons and internal layers of 10B for their\n    efficiency. These sensors are also enclosed by Cd shields that\n    absorb all neutrons with energies below ~0.4 eV, which mainly\n    correspond to thermal neutrons. The neutron collimator provides\n    the instrument Field of View (FOV): epithermal neutrons of direct\n    flux inside the FOV are recorded by the detector, while the\n    majority of neutrons outside the FOV are absorbed by the\n    collimator. This collimation technique provides mapping of\n    epithermal neutrons from the Moon's surface with the horizontal\n    resolution of 5 km for LRO at an altitude of 50 km.\n \n    The final LEND sensor is the Sensor for High Energy Neutrons\n    (SHEN), which is a stilbene scintillator that produces a\n    flash of light each time a high energy neutron in the energy\n    range 0.3 to 15.0 MeV collides with a hydrogen nucleus and\n    creates a recoil proton. Special shape-sensitive electronics\n    distinguish proton counts from electron counts, and an active\n    anti-coincidence shield eliminates external charged particles.\n    This sensor is installed inside the central hole of the\n    collimation unit, and its Field of View corresponds to\n    40-degree (HWHM). The SHEN sensor outputs data in 16 energy\n    channels from 300 keV to more than 15 MeV, and is the source\n    of the SC1-3 spectra.\n \n    For further information about the LEND instrument and the\n    LEND experiment please see MITROFANOVETAL2008].\n \n \n  Scientific Objectives\n  =====================\n    The science objectives of neutron mapping of the Moon are\n    outlined by three investigation tasks developed by the\n    LRO team.\n \n    Task (1) is to explain the origin of the neutron flux depressions\n    in the lunar polar regions, which could be produced by enhancement\n    of implanted hydrogen from the solar wind, or by accumulated\n    deposits of water ice from comet impacts in shadowed craters.\n \n    Task (2) focuses on the variation of hydrogen content at moderate\n    latitudes of the Moon in comparison to surface variations of\n    minerals, thermal conductivity and soil maturity.\n \n    Task (3) corresponds to the measurement of neutrons over a broad\n    energy range from thermal energies up to tens of MeV to determine\n    the neutron contribution to the total radiation dose at an altitude\n    of 50 km above the Moon.\n \n    The Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) will sddress these\n    tasks by:\n \n    Creating high resolution Hydrogen distribution maps with\n    sensitivity of about 100 ppm of Hydrogen weight and horizontal\n    spatial resolution of 5 km.\n \n    Characterizing surface distribution and column density of\n    possible near-surface water ice deposits in the Moon's polar\n    cold traps.\n \n    Creating a global model of neutron component of space\n    radiation at altitude of 30-50 km above Moon's surface with\n    spatial resolution of 20-50 km at the spectral range from\n    thermal energies up to 15 MeV.\n \n \n  Calibration\n  ===========\n    Calibration information for the LEND instrument is provided\n    in the LEND Calibration Report\n    (calib/LEND_calibration_report.pdf).\n \n \n  Operational Modes\n  =================\n    LEND operates autonomously, collecting data throughout the\n    lunar orbit. LEND generates approximately 0.26 Gbits of\n    measurement data per day. In order to perform early calibration\n    measurements, LEND became active shortly after the first mid\n    course correction (MCC) burn. Operationally, LEND is simple and\n    has only three instrument modes: MEASUREMENTS, STAND-BY, and\n    OFF. While in MEASUREMENTS mode, instrument electronics and\n    detector high voltage are both 'on' and the instrument\n    generates measurement and housekeeping data. In STAND-BY mode,\n    instrument electronics are 'on', detector high voltage is 'off',\n    and only housekeeping data are generated. While in OFF mode,\n    the instrument is 'off', the instrument external heater is\n    'on', and only external temperature data are generated.","tools":[]},{"tags":["Altimeter"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lola.lro","display_name":"Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA)","display_description":"INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW\n===================\n    The LOLA instrument was designed, built and tested by the NASA Goddard\n    Space Flight Center (GSFC). The principal investigator is David E. Smith\n    (GSFC), and the deputy PI is Maria Zuber (MIT). LOLA has two primary\n    objectives.\n \n    First, it will produce a high-resolution global topographic model and\n    geodetic framework that will assist with precise targeting, safe landing,\n    and surface mobility for future scientific and exploration activities.\n    LOLA will also characterize the polar illumination environment and image\n    the Moon's permanently-shadowed regions (PSRs) to identify possible\n    locations of surface ice crystals in shadowed polar craters.\n \n    To achieve these primary objectives, LOLA will make three measurements:\n \n     1) the distance between the surface and the spacecraft,\n     2) the spreading of the returned laser pulse, and\n     3) the transmitted and returned laser energies.\n \n    LOLA is a pulse detection, time-of-flight laser altimeter. LOLA transmits\n    a 5-spot pattern that measures the precise distance to the lunar surface\n    at multiple points simultaneously, thus providing 5 profiles across the\n    lunar surface (Figure 1).  Each spot within the five-spot pattern has a\n    diameter of five meters; the spots are 25 meters apart in the form of a\n    cross canted by 26 degrees counterclockwise to provide five adjacent\n    profiles.\n \n    The 5-spot pattern enables the surface slope to be derived in the along-\n    track and across track directions. LOLA's instrument design is similar to\n    the designs of the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (SMITHETAL2001B) and the\n    Mercury Laser Altimeter (CAVANAUGHETAL2007), augmented by a novel\n    diffractive optic element (DOE) (SMITHETAL2009).\n \n    It has five beams and five receiver channels, the first of which is also\n    fiber-optic-coupled to a Laser Ranging (LR) telescope mounted on the High-\n    Gain Antenna. Because LOLA makes global observations, the LOLA altimetry\n    data can be used to improve the spacecraft orbit and our knowledge of far\n    side lunar gravity, which is currently extremely poorly known but is\n    required for precise landing and low-altitude navigation. Timing of one-\n    way pulses fired from Earth to the LR will also improve navigation and\n    gravity determination.\n \n    The five received laser pulses are time stamped with respect to the\n    spacecraft mission elapsed time using a set of time-to-digital converters\n    at <0.5 ns precision. LOLA measures the transmitted and received pulse\n    energies by integrating the pulse waveforms. The on-board science\n    algorithm, running on an embedded microprocessor, autonomously adjusts the\n    receiver detection threshold levels, detector gain, and range window for\n    the lunar surface returns.\n \n  ----\n \n      #4\n               #5\n         #1       ---- # shot 3\n    #3\n            #2\n      @4\n               @5\n         @1       ---- @ shot 2\n    @3\n            @2\n      *4\n               *5\n         *1       ---- * shot 1\n    *3\n            *2\n \n \n    Figure 1.

The algorithm seeks to\n    maximize the probability of detection under varying background noise\n    conditions, by utilizing hardware noise counters in a fashion similar to\n    that employed on the MOLA and MLA instruments. A variable range gate\n    setting opens only during the window of time that returns are expected\n    from the surface according to the FSW return histograms. To accomodate the\n    large dynamic range of lunar return strength, a variable gain amplifier is\n    implemented in hardware prior to the discriminator input. The gain is set\n    according to tables of range setting - gain setting, one for each\n    detector. Earth laser ranges are recorded by detector 1 during the 8 ms\n    window preceding each laser fire, approximately 1-9 ms after the start of\n    each 28-Hz cycle. The Earth window uses the same threshold and gain\n    settings as for lunar ranges. Owing to higher background earth counts,\n    especially during New Moon phases, the detector 1 thresholds are likely\n    higher than those of the detector 2-5 channels.\n \n  ---------------\n \n    The data are downlinked to the Ground Data System in the Mission\n    Operations Center and are transferred to the LOLA SOC at the end of each\n    downlink pass. LOLA ground software assembles the telemetry files into EDR\n    data tables, each covering a ~10-minute time period. A housekeeping\n    telemetry data stream, which is a subset of the science telemetry, is sent\n    to the LOLA SOC in realtime during tracking passes. The realtime\n    housekeeping provides energy and signal processing information for the\n    pulses generated by the LR component.\n \n    The LOLA Measurement Team, Institution, and responsibilities\n \n    David E.

Consequently the instrument has no moving parts; it\n    acquires data in the seven channels in a 'pushframe' mode, with scanning\n    of the WAC FOV provided by motion of the spacecraft and target. Continuous\n    color coverage of the lunar surface is possible by repeated imaging such\n    that each of the narrow framelets of each color band overlap. The WAC has\n    a readout noise less than 72 e- and, as with the NAC, pixel values are\n    digitized to 12 bits and are then commanded to 8 bit values through a\n    square-root-like lookup table. WAC specifications are summarized in Table\n    2. The two UV bands (320 and 360 nm) undergo 4x4 pixel on-chip analog\n    summing before digitization to achieve better signal-to-noise ratio.\n    Thus, UV pixels are recorded at reduced 383.5 m/pixel sampling but have\n    improved signal properties. Only the center 704 pixels for the visible are\n    digitized when all seven bands are being acquired. WAC band passes are\n    arranged first UV then VIS (320, 360, 415, 565, 605, 645, 690), but the\n    order is reversed after LRO performs a 180 degree yaw maneuver to align\n    the solar panels with the sun.\n \n    Figure 1 -

Mini-RF also will gather data on several repeat\n   passes that are designed to support interferometric processing. The radar\n   architecture is hybrid-polarimetric: transmitting circular polarization,\n   and receiving coherently H and V linear polarizations. The resulting data\n   are sufficient to calculate the classical Circular-Polarization-Ratio\n   (CPR), and also Stokes parameters for more sensitive image analysis.\n \n   The primary imaging modes have two resolutions Baseline\n   (150 m at 16 looks), and Zoom (15 m by 30 m at 8 looks) each at two\n   frequencies, S-band (12-cm wavelength) or X-band (4-cm wavelength).\n \n   The communications demonstrations will be receive-only, and transmit-only,\n   both with a cooperating earth-based facility. The communications will be\n   at S-band (12-cm wavelength), and will contribute to calibration of the\n   antenna pattern's polarimetric characterization.\n \n  Scientific Objectives:\n  ======================\n   The primary scientific objective of the Mini-RF mission\n   is to search for water-ice deposits in permanently-shadowed areas of the\n   north and south polar regions of the Moon.  Water-ice is known to cause\n   anomalous radar reflectivity signatures (high albedo and high circular\n   polarization ratio) that differ significantly from the most radar\n   reflections from typical anhydrous lunar surface material.\n \n   As an additional scientific objective, the Mini-RF mission will\n   characterize the lunar surface roughness at radar wavelength scales\n   (12-cm and 4-cm) by analysis of the polarimetric properties of the radar\n   backscatter.\n \n  Calibration:\n  ============\n \n   Amplitude calibration\n   ---------------------\n   The Mini-RF radar data product is comprised of the amplitude\n   (or magnitude squared) of the H and the V channels of the\n   dual-polarized receiver, and also the cross-product of the complex\n   H and V amplitudes. These data are necessary and sufficient to form\n   the 2x2 coherency matrix of the backscattered field, which is\n   alternatively represented by the Stokes parameters, four real numbers.\n   The first Stokes parameter represents the total backscattered power. This\n   can be scaled to the normalized reflectivity sigma-zero only if the\n   end-to-end transformation of the radar is calibrated absolutely. The\n   starting point for this scaling is the set of pre-flight system data,\n   coupled with in-flight specifics such as incidence and altitude. During\n   the mission, absolute calibration will be up-dated by imaging a lunar\n   area whose reflectivity is well known from Earth-based radar\n   observatories. However, most lunar science measurements depend on ratios\n   of the Stokes parameters, for which absolute amplitude calibration is not\n   required. Rather, gain balance between the H and the V channels is the\n   key objective. Relative calibration consists of evaluating the corrective\n   scaling constant of the H amplitude relative to the V amplitude.\n   Calibration references (noise, tone, and chirp) are included at the\n   beginning and end of each data take to assist relative amplitude\n   calibration. During the mission, relative calibration will be up-dated by\n   radar coverage of the lunar surface at nadir, from which the observed\n   backscatter should have identical amplitudes seen through both the H and\n   the V channels. Any difference can be inverted to evaluate the relative\n   amplitude calibration constant. In addition, the mission plan calls for\n   relative amplitude calibration through a cooperative transmission and\n   reception between the spacecraft and an Earth-based radar observatory.\n   These data will be posted on the PDS when available. (If more specific\n   information is needed, please consult the Mini-RF Calibration Plan.)\n \n   Phase calibration\n   -----------------\n   The Mini-RF radar data product is comprised of the amplitude\n   (or magnitude squared) of the H and the V channels of the dual-polarized\n   receiver, and also the cross-product of the complex H and V amplitudes.\n   The cross-product is one representation of the phase to be calibrated.\n   These data are necessary and sufficient to form the 2x2 coherency matrix\n   of the backscattered field, which is alternatively represented by the\n   Stokes parameters, four real numbers. The first Stokes parameter is the\n   total backscattered power (see Amplitude Calibration). Under the\n   operational assumption that the radar transmits circular polarization,\n   the relative phase (in the cross-product) is central to the third and the\n   fourth Stokes parameter. Relative phase calibration consists of\n   evaluating the corrective phase rotation constant of the H complex\n   amplitude relative to the V complex amplitude such that the average phase\n   difference between them is +/-90 degrees (whose sign depends on whether\n   right- or left-circular polarization was transmitted) under the condition\n   that the average reflecting surface is specular. The starting position\n   for relative phase calibration is the set of pre-flight system data,\n   coupled with in-flight measurements based on the radar's calibration\n   references (see Amplitude Calibration).  During the mission, relative\n   phase calibration will be up-dated by radar coverage of the lunar\n   surface at nadir, from which the observed averaged backscatter should\n   have known relative phase between the H and the V channels. Any\n   difference can be inverted to evaluate the relative phase rotation\n   calibration constant. In addition, the mission plan calls for relative\n   phase calibration through a cooperative transmission and reception\n   between the spacecraft and an Earth-based radar observatory. These data\n   will be posted on the PDS when available. (If more specific information\n   is needed, please consult the Mini-RF Calibration Plan.)\n \n  Operational Modes:\n  ==================\n   The Mini-RF instrument has two imaging modes: Synthetic Aperture Radar\n   (SAR) and Interferometry. The SAR modes, at two wavelengths\n   (12-cm and 4-cm), each have two resolutions (150 m at 16 looks, and 15m\n   by 30m at 8 looks). Only one combination of wavelength, and resolution\n   may be operated at the same time. Data will be gathered on a\n   non-interference basis with respect to the primary LRO instruments, over\n   selected sites N/S poleward of plus/minus 80 degrees latitude. SAR\n   interferometric data takes will be on an as-opportunity-allows basis.\n \n  Sensors:\n  ==========\n   The radar is primarily a demonstration exercise, to prove the feasibility\n   of a 15-kg class instrument in lunar orbit to support communications tasks\n   as well as high-quality imaging data collection.\n \n  Electronics:\n  ============\n   The Mini-RF assembly consists of two sections, the antenna (a passive array\n   of H and V elements, of about 1 square meter area), and electronics\n   (packaged in three individual sub-assemblies).","tools":[]},{"tags":["Spectrometer"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:iris.mr9","display_name":"Mariner 9 Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer","display_description":"INSTRUMENT: INFRARED INTERFEROMETER SPECTROMETER\n  SPACECRAFT: MARINER 9\n \n \n  Instrument Information\n  ======================\n    Instrument Id                  : IRIS\n    Instrument Host Id             : MR9\n    PI Pds User Id                 : BJCONRATH\n    Instrument Name                : INFRARED INTERFEROMETER\n                                     SPECTROMETER\n    Instrument Type                : INFRARED INTERFEROMETER\n    Instrument Mass                : 22.3\n    Instrument Serial Number       : IRIS M\n    Instrument Manufacturer Name   : TEXAS INSTRUMENTS\n \n \n  Instrument Description\n  ======================\n    The Mariner 9 Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS)\n    instrument is a Michelson interferometer with a circular\n    aperture 4.3 cm in diameter.  The field of view is also\n    circular, with an angular diameter of approximately 4.4 degrees.\n    The effective spectral range of the interferometer is 200-2000\n    cm**-1, and the apodized spectral resolution is 2.4 cm**-1.  The\n    dwell time for each interferogram is 18.2 s.  An\n    image-motion-compensating mirror, inclined at an angle of 45\n    degrees to the axis of rotation, is part of the instrument;\n    however, it was never used for motion compensation.  The beam\n    splitter of the interferometer consists of a multilayer\n    dielectric coating applied to a CsI substrate.  The moving\n    mirror mounted on one end of a motor shaft is driven at a\n    constant velocity of 0.0235 cm/s during the recording of an\n    interferogram.  The fringe-control/reference interferometer uses\n    the same moving mirror, beamsplitter and fixed mirror, but a\n    different optical path than the IR signal, making use of the\n    center of the beamsplitter.  The center of the beamsplitter is\n    coated to perform well in the visible and near-infrared for the\n    reference interferometer.  A 0.6929 micrometer neon line source\n    is used for the reference interferometer with a photomultiplier\n    detector.  The signal from this unit, along with a velocity\n    transducer, provides feedback control of the main\n    interferometer, and as an initiator for the analog to digital\n    conversion process.  Synchronization of the data stream with the\n    spacecraft clock is accomplished by a phased locked loop which\n    slaves the mirror motion to the highly stable clock frequency.\n    The main IR detector is a thermister bolometer operating at 250\n    K with a bias voltage of 500 V.  The entrance window of the\n    instrument is also CsI to permit operation to 200 cm**-1.  The\n    window seals the interferometer from moisture and dust, and it\n    supports an optical filter designed to reflect sunlight and\n    thermal radiation below 2500 cm**-1.  The filter also protected\n    the CsI window from atmospheric degradation during storage and\n    launch.  Calibration is provided by alternatively viewing deep\n    space and a built-in blackbody maintained at a temperature of\n    296.4 K (see instrument calibration description) by rotation of\n    the image motion compensation mirror.  The dynamic range of the\n    instrument is 8000:1 with an NER (noise equivalent radiance) of\n    0.5 x 10**-7 W cm**-2 sr**-1/cm**-1.\n \n    The temperature of the instrument is passively and actively\n    controlled to operate at a nominal temperature of 250.0 +/- 0.2\n    K.  One surface of the instrument is not covered by thermal\n    insulation; it acts as a passive radiator to deep space.  Active\n    thermal control is maintained by the action of thermostatically\n    controlled heaters.  The thermostat kept the IRIS optical module\n    temperature constant to within +/- 0.2 K from the time of the\n    initial cooldown prior to launch, through the transit phase, and\n    during orbital operation at Mars [HANEL_ETAL_1972A,\n    HANEL_ETAL_1972B, HANEL_ETAL_1972C].\n \n \n  Scientific Objectives\n  =====================\n    The scientific objectives of the Mariner 9 Infrared\n    Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) investigation include the\n    following:\n \n    (1) Determination of the carbon dioxide pressure at the surface.\n    (2) Determination of the vertical temperature profile of the\n        atmosphere.\n    (3) Determination of the total amount of atmospheric water\n        vapor.\n    (4) Identification and determination of the abundances of other\n        minor atmospheric constituents.\n    (5) Determination of surface temperatures.\n    (6) Determination of chemical or mineralogical composition and\n        information of the physical structure of the surface layer,\n        including polar deposits.\n \n    These objectives are accomplished through the analysis of\n    measurements of thermal emission spectra.\n \n \n  Calibration\n  ===========\n    Calibration spectra were periodically recorded while observing\n    either deep space or an on-board warm blackbody (T = 296.4 K).\n    One pair of calibration spectra is generated for every 14\n    spectra of Mars (7 spectra of Mars, on-board black-body, 7\n    spectra of Mars, deep space, etc.).  Scaling of the raw Martian\n    spectra to the calibration spectra specifies the Martian spectra\n    in absolute radiometric units.  The calibration procedure for\n    the Mariner 9 spectra is similar to that previously described\n    for Nimbus 4, see HANEL_ETAL_1972D.  The excellent thermal\n    stability of the Mariner 9 IRIS permitted the entire ensemble of\n    1766 calibration pairs acquired during the Mariner mission to be\n    averaged to provide a single set of calibration parameters.\n    Consequently, the random error introduced into the individual\n    target spectra from calibration is extremely small.\n \n    The calibration is carried out independently for each wavenumber\n    interval by using the equation I = B(Tw) * (C1 - C2) / A1 / (C3\n    - C2), where C1 = the instantaneous spectral amplitude for Mars,\n    C2 = the average of the spectral amplitudes for the cold\n    calibration source (deep space), and C3 = the average of the\n    spectral amplitudes for the warm calibration source (on-board\n    reference blackbody).  B(Tw) is the Planck function for the\n    temperature of the warm reference blackbody (Tw).  Tw is an\n    average of eight transducer measurements made immediately before\n    and after each interferogram.  A1 is the reciprocal value of the\n    emissivity of the black paint used in the warm calibration\n    source, an aluminum plate with 30 degree V-shaped grooves\n    painted with 3M 401-C10 Black Velvet paint.  While this paint is\n    relatively black over most of the instrument spectral range,\n    small glass beads contained in it give rise to emittance\n    variations of a few percent near 480 cm**-1 and 1100 cm**-1\n    which are characteristic wave numbers of silicon dioxide.  The\n    correction factor was derived from laboratory reflectance\n    measurements on a duplicate blackbody, from similar measurements\n    on the same type of paint, kindly made available by James\n    Aronson (private communication), and finally from comparisons of\n    the warm and cold calibrations of the interferometer while in\n    orbit around Mars.  All three methods were in agreement;\n    consequently, the emissivity correction of the warm calibration\n    source has been applied to all spectra.

The\n    noise equivalent spectral radiance (NESR), a measure of the\n    random errors in the measurements, is calculated from the\n    standard deviation of the individual instantaneous\n    responsivities.  The derivation and description of all the\n    instrumental parameters are discussed in detail in\n    HANELETAL1972D. Reference, responsivity, noise, and instrument\n    temperature spectra are included in the auxiliary data of the\n    MARINER9-MARS-IRIS-3-RDR-V1.0 dataset.  Small, narrow spikes are\n    present in the instrument NESR at the following locations:\n \n    nu(cm-1)      f(Hz)         Probable Source\n    ----------------------------------------------------\n     356.          8.36         8-1/3 bps-telemetry rate\n     713.         16.76         2 (8-1/3)\n    1069.         25.12         4 (8-1/3)\n    1203.         28.27         Unknown\n    1426.         33.52         4 (8-1/3) & 33-1/3\n    1782.         41.88         5 (8-1/3)\n \n    The most probable sources of most of these spikes are transients\n    caused by the engineering telemetry channels which have\n    characteristic frequencies of 8-1/3 and 33-1/3 bps.  The source\n    of the interference at 28.27 Hz is unknown.\n \n    In addition to the radiometric calibration, a wave number\n    correction has been applied to the data.  The finite solid\n    angles of the primary and reference interferometers cause a\n    small wave number shift and a distortion of the true wave number\n    scale.  This well known effect, caused by the interference of\n    on-axis and off-axis rays, has been corrected for empirically.\n    A numerical fit of a Lorentzian function was made to determine\n    the center wave number position nu_m and nu_t of the strongest\n    carbon dioxide features in a measured and in a theoretical\n    spectrum, respectively.  The correction adopted to provide the\n    theoretical wave number scale is nu_t = (0.016187 + nu_m) /\n    1.0010602.  This adjustment has been incorporated in the\n    calculation of the wave number mesh for the calibrated\n    radiances.\n \n \n  Operational Considerations\n  ==========================\n    The Mariner 9 IRIS instrument operated normally throughout the\n    mission.  As discussed in the Instrument Calibration\n    Description, the excellent thermal stability of the Mariner 9\n    IRIS permitted the entire ensemble of 1766 calibration pairs\n    acquired during the Mariner mission to be averaged to provide a\n    single set of calibration parameters.  Consequently, the random\n    error introduced into the individual target spectra from the\n    calibration is extremely small.  However, a detailed analysis of\n    emission angle pairs of spectra has determined that there may be\n    a very minor calibration error due to a small spike in one of\n    the calibration interferograms.  Additionally, for spectra taken\n    of areas with extremely low temperatures the NESR dominates at\n    high wavenumbers causing the calculated brightness temperatures\n    to increase with increasing wavenumber.\n \n \n  Instrument Detectors\n  ====================\n    The detector of the infrared interferometer is a thermister\n    bolometer operating at 250 K with a bias voltage of 500 V.\n \n \n  Instrument Electronics\n  ======================\n    The bulk of the analog and all of the digital circuitry is in an\n    electronics module located in the support base for the\n    interferometer module.  The parity and summation electronics are\n    in a separate box attached to the support base electronics\n    module.  The primary and standby power supplies and the\n    interface chassis are part of the Mariner octagonal spacecraft\n    bus structure.  The electronics box contains timing and control\n    elements, mirror drive circuitry, housekeeping monitors, thermal\n    controllers, and analog-to-digital converters.\n \n \n  Instrument Optics\n  =================\n    All mirrors of the interferometer are gold coated.  The fixed\n    interferometer mirror is the entrance pupil for the optical\n    system.  It has an effective circular aperture of 3.5 cm\n    diameter.  An ellipsoidal mirror collects the energy from the\n    interferometer and focuses it onto the infrared detector, a\n    thermister bolometer, which serves as the exit pupil.\n \n \n  Instrument Offset\n  =================\n    The instrument and the associated electronics modules are bolted\n    to the scan platform.  The primary and standby power supplies\n    and the interface chassis are part of the octagonal electronics\n    rack of the spacecraft.  The instrument is approximately\n    bore-sighted with the television camera, ultraviolet\n    spectrometer and infrared radiometer.\n \n \n  Instrument Parameters\n  =====================\n    Thermal Radiance (W cm-2 ster-1/cm-1).\n \n \n  Instrument Modes\n  ================\n    The instrument possesses only one operating mode.  When turned\n    on the instruments acquires one interferogram every 21 second\n    data frame.","is_prime":true,"tools":[]},{"tags":["Radio Transceiver"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:rss.lro","display_name":"Radio Science Subsystem","display_description":"Instrument Overview\n===================\n \nThe communication, tracking, and timekeeping systems on LRO support\nthe generation of the precise geolocation needed by the LRO science and\nmeasurement investigations.  The information provided by these systems is\nsimilar to conventional Radio Science data, although traditional 'radio\nscience' was not an initial mission objective. The importance of the\ntracking data for all of the other investigations merits its being archived\nfor completeness and future analysis.\n \nRadio Doppler and range tracking to the LRO omnidirectional and\nhigh-gain antennas (HGA) provides the main source of the radio science data.\nThe gimbaled HGA also carries a small, coboresighted, optical receiver\ntelescope. One-way time-of-flight from the ground to the optical receiver\nusing laser pulses provides an alternate tracking data type known as Laser\nRanging (LR), which is handled jointly by the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter\n(LOLA) Science Operations Center (SOC) and the Crustal Dynamics Data\nInformation System (CDDIS). The spacecraft Radio Frequency subsystems are\ndescribed herein and in more detail in [TOOLEYETAL2010]. The LR subsystem\nis described in [ZUBERETAL2009], and in the LOLA instrument description\n[SMITHETAL2009]. The ground elements consist of the commercial Universal\nSpace Network (USN), the Ka-band ground station at White Sands, New Mexico\n(WS1), and the Next Generation Satellite Laser Ranging station in Greenbelt,\nMaryland (NGSLR).\n \nAdditional data were provided by the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) during\ncommissioning. Ongoing participation by the International Laser Ranging\nService (ILRS) network of stations provides further LR data that are\nprocessed by the LOLA SOC.\n \nCommunication Subsystem\n-----------------------\nLRO's communications system consists of an S-band system to provide tracking,\ntelemetry and commanding (TT&C) and a high data rate Ka-band, downlink-only\nsystem for telemetry and science data transfers. The S-Band system has a fixed\nforward link data rate of 4 kbps, and a selectable on-orbit return link data\nrate between 125 bps and 1093 kbps. It consists of one Spacecraft Tracking\nand Data Network (STDN) compatible transponder, an S-band Radio Frequency\n(RF) Switch, and the RF paths to and from the two Omni-Directional antennas\nand the S- band feed on the High Gain Antenna (HGA).\n \nThe transponder downlinks at a frequency which is phase-locked to the uplink,\nproviding two-way Doppler tracking information to the ground with an accuracy\nof better than 1 mm/s.  It also repeats uplinked range tones with a fixed\ndelay, allowing the ground to determine the distance to the Orbiter within\n15 m. The Ka-band system includes a Ka-Band modulator, a Traveling Wave Tube\nAmplifier (TWTA) consisting of a traveling wave tube (TWT), an Electronic\nPower Conditioner (EPC), and a High Power Isolator. The Ka-band return link\nis also selectable on orbit and varies from 25 Mbps to 100 Mbps.\nAlthough the Ka-band system uses only the High Gain Antenna, the S-band\nsystem can utilize either the Omni-Directional or the High Gain Antenna for\ntransmit and always uses both paths for receiving. The ground selects the\nuplink path via polarization, as the HGA has opposite polarization from the\nomni antennas for this reason.  Specifications for each of the S- and Ka-Band\nsubsystems are given in [TOOLEYETAL2010]. In brief, frequency, polarization,\nand RF transmit power for the spacecraft are:\n \nS-Band System:\n2271.2 +/- 2.5 MHz (Transmit), 2091.3967 +/- 2.5 MHz (Receive);\nLeft Hand Circular Polarization (Omni)\nRight Hand Circular Polarization (HGA)\n5.8 Watt Diplexers\n \nKa-Band System:\n25.65 GHz +/- 150 MHz (Transmit)\nLeft Hand Circular Polarization\n41.9 Watt TWTA Output\n \nThe S-Comm card is designed to accommodate a telemetry interface to Earth\nusing S-Band frequencies. The S-Comm card is connected directly to the Single\nBoard Computer (SBC) via a 10 Mbps SpaceWire link [NGUYENETAL2008]. During\na ground station pass the data from the SBC flow directly into the S-Comm\ncard and are encoded for transmission per CCSDS recommendations for\ntelemetry encoding using concatenated encoding. The S-Comm provides one\ntelemetry stream at up to 1.093 Mbps to the transmitter for Bi-Phase Shift\nKeying (BPSK) modulation onto the RF carrier.The S-Comm accepts uplinked\nCCSDS telecommands from the S-Band transponder at 4 Kbps. Normally commands\nare forwarded to the SBC for further processing via the SpaceWire\ninterface unless they are tagged as hardware-decoded commands. Hardware-\ndecoded commands are performed directly by the S-Comm card. The S-Comm card\ncan support up to 8 hardware-decoded commands, 4 of which are RS-422 outputs.\nHardware- decoded commands are only used in contingency situations.Both the\nS-comm and Ka-comm card provide control of the respective Communication\nSubsystem transmitters via asynchronous low rate serial interfaces.\n \nLRO makes use of a global network of S-band ground stations for nominal\nspacecraft tracking (at least 30 minutes per orbit) and one Ka-band station\nfor downlink of all the stored instrument and spacecraft data. Nominally, LRO\nis never be out of contact with the ground for more than one hour at a time.\nStation-keeping maneuvers and instrument calibrations occur once a month.\nMomentum management maneuvers occur every 2 weeks. There is an S-band pass\nevery orbit (12 per day), and 4 (on average) Ka-band passes between LRO and\nWS1 every day, each lasting 45 minutes. The actual number fluctuates between\n2 and 6, as the Moon moves through its entire declination range each month\n(as seen from the Earth). Most of the instruments operate autonomously over\nthe course of a single orbit, while two (LROC and Mini-RF) require daily\ntailored command timelines. Nominally, LRO receives a new command timeline\nfrom the ground once per day that includes tracking schedules and antenna\ntargets.\n \nUltra Stable Oscillators (USO)\n------------------------------\nThe C&DH subsystem includes both a primary and a redundant USO to provide\nprecision timekeeping onboard the spacecraft. Each oscillator provides two\n20-MHz signals. One signal goes to the C&DH HK/IO card and the second goes\ndirectly to the LOLA instrument. Only one of the oscillators is powered\nat any given time. The primary USO has a frequency stability factor of 10\nparts per billion (ppb) over one millisecond (ms). It was chosen to provide\nsufficient stability to meet the needs of the laser ranging system.\nIt receives a +31VDC switched service from the Power Subsystem Electronics\n(PSE). The redundant USO has a frequency stability factor of 0.3\nparts per million (ppm) over one millisecond (ms). It was chosen to provide\nsufficient stability to meet the needs for LOLA reconstruction of the\norbital ephemeris. It receives a +15VDC switched service from the LVPC.\n \nData Downlink\n-------------\nThe LRO flight computer is a RAD-750 processor executing at 133 MHz.\nTwo 100 Gbyte recorders store science data for playback to the earth at\n100 Mbps. An S-band system provides command, engineering telemetry,\nand navigation functions. On a given day, about 460 Gbits of data are\ngenerated on-board the LRO spacecraft. Data are downlinked at 100 Mbps\nthrough a single Ka-band ground station at White Sands, New Mexico,\nUSA (designated WS1). Even in the worst case (2 passes), there is sufficient\ntime to downlink the entire day's data volume.\n \nActive One-Way Laser Ranging System\n-----------------------------------\nDuring the preliminary design phase an active one-way (uplink) laser ranging\nsystem was added to LRO to improve the tracking, and thus geodetic accuracy\nof the data products, over that possible with the S-Band tracking system\nalone.  The elements of the active laser ranging system include a ground\nstation at GSFC, which transmits a 532 nm pulse at 28 Hz. This pulse is\ncaptured by the laser ranging telescope mounted on the high gain antenna and\nthen transmitted via fiber optic cable to the LOLA detector assembly.\nTime-stamped arrival and departure times allow for precise range measurements\nfrom Earth to the LRO spacecraft, thus helping to determine precise position\nrelative to the Earth's surface. Those data, combined with known positioning\nof the spacecraft and LOLA data gathered from the Moon, provide enough\ninformation to improve the lunar gravity modeling which can, in turn, be used\nto improve the orbit determination.\n \nPassive Two-Way Laser Ranging System\n------------------------------------\nIn addition to the active laser ranging system LRO carries a retro-reflector\nassembly consisting of twelve 1-inch-diameter solid retro-reflective prisms\nin a square array mounted on the -Z face (zenith radiator). This retro-\nreflector allows high-power terrestrial laser ranging sites to perform\ntwo-way laser ranging to LRO. This ranging is conducted as an\nexperiment of opportunity late in the mission. The HGA must be parked for\nsafety and to provide visibility to the retro-reflector assembly from Earth.\nAs well, the array must point within approximately 20 degrees of Earth, which\nis only possible for a few days a month while LRO is in mapping\nconfiguration.\n \nGround stations\n---------------\nThe baseline tracking system for LRO is an S-band (2.2-2.3 GHZ) radio\nfrequency link for approximately ~20 hours per day [CHINETAL2007].  A\ncommercial network, the Universal Space Network (USN), provides\ntracking with stations at Dongara, Australia; Kiruna, Sweden; Weilham,\nGermany; and South Point, Hawaii. The Doppler accuracy of the USN is ~1 mm/s\n(one sigma) averaged over 10 s, which for the tracking time allocated\npermits LRO orbits to be determined to approximately ~10 m radially and 300\nm along-track and across-track.\n \nSeveral ILRS stations [PEARLMANETAL2008] participate in the\nLR investigation as ground stations. The addition of ILRS stations provides\nglobal coverage for LR and increases the laser ranging data set. A few of the\nparticipating ILRS stations are also synchronizing their laser fires to the\nLOLA Earth window in a similar manner to NGSLR, while several others are\nfiring asynchronously at 5 or 10 Hz. At 10 Hz only 2 to 4 pulses per second\nfall in the LOLA Earth window. The remaining 6-8 pulses are treated\nas noise by LOLA, but these are not enough to cause significant disruptions\nto the LOLA measurements. Since this is an uplink-only ranging measurement,\nthere is no real-time feedback of spacecraft tracking as in normal SLR\noperations.  Instead, LOLA's real-time housekeeping telemetry is used to\nprovide needed feedback to the stations. LOLA's onboard signal processing\nindicates whether the Earth pulses are arriving at LRO, and in addition\ntracks the time at which these pulses occur within the Earth window. The LOLA\nEarth energy monitor also provides an integrated energy over each Earth\nwindow.

Heaters were also included in the LR instrument\n    for the detectors and test chambers.  A number of published\n    papers describe the characteristics and performance of the LR\n    instrument.  The scientific rationale and early design of the\n    instrument are described in LEVIN1972 and a detailed description\n    of the flight module is given in LEVIN&STRAAT1976A.  A summary of\n    the information from these papers is given here as a high-level\n    description of the LR instrument and its operation.  The Labeled\n    Release instrument was part of a package of three biology\n    experiments on the Viking Landers [KLEIN1974].\n \n \n  Science Objectives\n  ==================\n    The major scientific objectives of the Viking Lander biology\n    investigation were to detect the plausibility and/or presence of\n    life on Mars.  In particular, the LR experiment was designed to\n    detect microbial life in the martian soil.  The Labeled Release\n    experiment tested for heterotrophic metabolism by monitoring the\n    release of radioactive gases from a soil sample inoculated with\n    carbon-14 labeled organic substrates.  The experiment also was\n    designed to analyze control samples that were heat sterilized.\n \n    Several assumptions were used in the design and operation of the\n    Labeled Release experiment.  These assumptions included the\n    following: A) life on Mars was carbon based; B) one or more of\n    the nutrient compounds would be metabolized by possible microbial\n    life; and C) one end product of metabolism would be a carbon\n    based gas.\n \n \n  LR Detailed Description\n  =======================\n    The Labeled Release instrument contained four incubation test\n    cells mounted on a carousel.  Each test cell could be rotated and\n    sealed beneath an assembly that contained a heater, plumbing\n    terminals for nutrient delivery and gas removal, and a tube\n    leading to the beta detectors.  Gas and nutrient moving through\n    the plumbing system were controlled by eight miniaturized\n    solenoid valves.  The headspace was connected to the two\n    solid-state beta detectors through a tube bent at several spots.\n    The connecting tube was bent to prevent radioactive particles\n    from reaching the detectors from the test cell.  The instrument\n    also had two temperature sensors.  One sensor measured the\n    temperature of the detectors and the other measured the\n    temperature of the headspace within the test cell.  For a\n    schematic and photographs of the Labeled Release instrument see\n    LEVIN&STRAAT1976A.\n \n    The Labeled Release nutrient was stored in a sealed glass ampoule\n    within a reservoir.  The reservoir, in turn, was connected to the\n    test cells by the instrument plumbing system.  The ampoule\n    containing the nutrient was broken by a mechanical striker driven\n    by high pressure helium shortly after the spacecraft landed on\n    the surface of Mars.  Low pressure helium was then bubbled\n    through the nutrient in the reservoir for several hours in order\n    to degas the nutrient.  At the start of an analysis cycle high\n    pressure helium was used to route a portion of the nutrient into\n    a sealed test cell.  Testing prior to launch indicated that 0.115\n    cc +/- 8% of nutrient was delivered during each injection.  The\n    pressure in the test cell headspace was kept above Mars ambient\n    atmospheric pressure with helium from the plumbing system to\n    prevent boiling of the nutrient.  The total pressure at the start\n    of an analysis cycle was about 9200 Pa (92 millibar).  At the end\n    of an analysis cycle, radioactive gas was purged from the test\n    cell through the plumbing system.\n \n    The LR instrument had two identical solid-state beta detectors\n    (Geiger counters) to monitor the evolved radioactive gas from the\n    soil sample.  There were two detectors as a contingency against\n    failure of one detector.  The detectors continuously counted\n    gaseous radioactivity as it evolved from the test cell.  The\n    instrument could be commanded to count with either one or both\n    detectors.  Detectors were referred to as the right and left\n    channels.  The Viking Landers were powered by radioisotope\n    thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which provided background\n    radiation to the detectors.  As a result, this background signal\n    had to be determined by monitoring the detectors for one to\n    several Mars days before nutrient was injected into a test cell.\n \n    The test cell heaters were used in a number of ways.  Samples\n    could be heated in the test cell prior to nutrient injections to\n    provide sterilized control samples.  During an analysis cycle the\n    test cell was heated to prevent the temperature from falling\n    below 9-10 degree C during the martian night.  The heater was\n    also used at the end of an analysis cycle to dry the sample.\n \n    The Labeled Release instrument shared common support services\n    with the other biology instruments.  This included the sample\n    delivery system [KLEIN1974].  Martian soil samples were collected\n    by the Viking Lander surface sampler arm [MOOREETAL1987;\n    CROUCH1977].  Soil from the sampler arm was dumped into a hopper\n    on top of the lander.  The hopper contained a sieve that only\n    allowed particles less than 2 mm in size to enter the instrument\n    test cells.  The sieved samples entered a distribution assembly\n    that automatically delivered measured volumes of soil to each\n    biology experiment [KLEIN1974].  The Labeled Release instrument\n    typically received 0.5 cc of soil.\n \n    The Biology common support services and the Labeled Release\n    instrument held enough nutrient and helium to conduct up to two\n    injections on four soil samples.  Testing prior to launch showed\n    that after proper drying of a soil sample and purging of gases\n    from a test cell that the cell could be used a second time by\n    adding more soil and nutrient.  One of the test cells on Viking\n    Lander 2 was used a second time.\n \n \n  Nutrient Description\n  ====================\n    Considerable effort went into selecting, preparing, and testing\n    the nutrients for the Label Release experiment\n    [LEVIN&STRAAT1976A].  Selection criteria were partially based on\n    the assumption that life evolved similarly on Mars as on Earth.\n    There were several criteria used in selecting compounds for the\n    nutrient that included: A) Compounds that were likely to be\n    produced on Mars; B) Compounds that primitive organisms were\n    likely to use in metabolism based on terrestrial analogs; and C)\n    Compounds that were unlikely to have nonbiological reactions with\n    martian soil.  In addition, each compound in the nutrient was\n    tested to show that it produced a rapid response in a variety of\n    terrestrial soils and in cultures of several types of organisms.\n    The stability of the materials was also considered given that the\n    nutrient was stored for about 2 years from the time it was\n    prepared until it was used on Mars.  The storage period included\n    the nearly one year cruise phase of the spacecraft on its journey\n    to Mars.  Nutrient material also had to undergo sterilization of\n    the biology module (54 hr at 120 degree C) and the entire\n    spacecraft (20 hr at 100 degree C).  It was expected that some\n    decomposition (<1%) of the nutrient would occur due to the long\n    storage time and sterilization.  Any radioactive carbon dioxide\n    produced by the nutrient decomposition was removed by flushing\n    the nutrient reservoir with helium before the first injection.  A\n    complete list of nutrient compounds is given in\n    LEVIN&STRAAT1976A.  The nutrient included sodium formate, calcium\n    glycolate, glycine, D- and L-alanine, sodium D-lactate and sodium\n    L-lactate.  The concentrations of each nutrient component were\n    dilute in case any particular compound was toxic to possible\n    martian organisms.  Each compound in the nutrient was labeled\n    with a precise amount of radioactive carbon-14.\n \n \n  Operation and Sampling Modes\n  ============================\n    The basic analysis cycle for the Labeled Release experiment was\n    to have a sample of martian soil delivered to a test cell and to\n    be moistened with an aqueous solution of carbon-14 labeled\n    organic media.  A second nutrient injection was typically done\n    about 7-8 Mars days after the first injection.  The headspace\n    above the sample was monitored continuously for evolved\n    radioactive gas as evidence for metabolism.  Viking Lander 1\n    completed four cycles, whereas Viking Lander 2 completed five\n    cycles for a total of nine cycles between the two landers.  VL2\n    cycle 5 was performed in a previously used test cell using a\n    stored portion of the cycle 4 soil sample.  Eight of the cycles\n    received two injections of nutrient.  VL1 cycle 3 received three\n    injections of nutrient.\n \n    Three of the analysis cycles were control cycles where the soil\n    sample was heated for several hours before nutrient injection.\n    The control cycle for Viking Lander 1 was heated to 160 degree C.\n    After receiving highly attenuated results from Viking Lander 1,\n    Viking Lander 2 control cycles were modified to be 50 degree C.\n \n    Radioactivity was counted for 16-minute intervals during an\n    analysis cycle, except for several hours around the time of\n    nutrient injection where intervals of 2- to 4-minutes were used.\n    Background levels were determined by measuring the test cell for\n    several Mars days prior to nutrient injection.  The headspace and\n    detector temperatures were measured every 16 minutes throughout\n    an analysis cycle.\n \n    At the end of the cycle, the radioactive gas was removed by\n    purging and the soil was dried by brief heating to prevent\n    evaporation upon opening the cell.  A fresh test cell was then\n    rotated beneath the head end assembly and a three-hour cleanup\n    was accomplished by heating both the head assembly and detectors\n    during continuous helium purging.  After cooling, trapped\n    nutrient was vented from the system.\n \n    The instrument was fairly automated with preprogrammed sequences.\n    Commands could be sent from the ground to change the\n    preprogrammed sequences to perform nutrient injections, to select\n    active or control sequences, to select a fresh soil sample, and\n    to initiate or terminate an analysis cycle.  Commands could be\n    sent to conduct single or double channel counting.\n \n \n  Principal Investigator\n  ======================\n    The principal investigator for the Viking Lander Labeled Release\n    experiment was Dr.  Gilbert V.  Levin of Biospherics, Inc.  Much\n    of the work on selecting the nutrient was directed by\n    Co-Investigator Dr.  Patricia Ann Straat.","tools":[]},{"tags":["Sensor Package"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:met.vl1","display_name":"Viking Lander 1 Meteorology Instrument System","display_description":"INSTRUMENT: VIKING METEOROLOGY INSTRUMENT SYSTEM\n    SPACECRAFT: VIKING LANDER 1\n \n \n    Instrument Information\n    ======================\n      Instrument Id                  : MET\n      Instrument Host Id             : VL1\n      Pi Pds User Id                 : SLHESS\n      Instrument Name                : VIKING METEOROLOGY INSTRUMENT\n                                       SYSTEM\n      Instrument Type                : IN SITU METEOROLOGY\n      Build Date                     : UNK\n      Instrument Mass                : UNK\n      Instrument Length              : UNK\n      Instrument Width               : UNK\n      Instrument Height              : UNK\n      Instrument Serial Number       : UNK\n      Instrument Manufacturer Name   : UNK\n \n \n    Instrument Description\n    ======================\n      The Viking Meteorology Instrument System (VMIS) aboard the\n      Viking Landers was designed to measure atmospheric temperature,\n      atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and wind direction.  The VMIS\n      consists of three major assemblies:\n \n      1) The Meteorology Sensor Array (MSA), which supports\n      the wind and temperature sensors and provides a\n      housing for the low-level electronics.\n      2) The Meteorology Boom Assembly (MBA), which\n      provides the means for positioning the MSA after\n      landing.  Following deployment of the MBA, the MSA is\n      positioned nominally 1.6 meters above the ground, 0.7\n      meter above the top of the Lander body, and about 0.3\n      meter horizontally outward from the closest portion\n      of the Lander body.\n      3) The Meteorology Electronic Assembly (MEA), which\n      provides power to the sensors and conditions the\n      signals from the sensors so that the proper interface\n      with the Lander electronic system is maintained.\n \n      The individual sensors are described below (see\n      CHAMBERLAIN_ETAL1976):\n \n      The ambient pressure sensor is located in the Lander body near\n      the MEA and has an external pressure line running to a port on\n      the bottom plate of the Lander body.  The sensor is a\n      stretched-diaphragm-type variable reluctance transducer that\n      operates over a range of 0 to 18 millibars.\n \n      The ambient temperature sensor consists of three\n      Chromel-Constantan thermocouples wired in parallel.  It is\n      capable of measuring over the entire range of expected martian\n      temperatures with an accuracy of about 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n \n      The reference temperature sensor was a platinum resistance\n      thermometer mounted between the wind speed elements (see\n      below).\n \n      Wind speed is measured by means of two hot film anemometers\n      oriented orthogonal to each other and lying in the horizontal\n      plane.  These hot film elements were maintained at a nominal\n      overheat temperature of 100 degrees Celsius above the air\n      temperature measured by the reference temperature sensor.  The\n      power required to maintain each anemometer at the specified\n      temperature was a function of the component of the wind speed\n      orthogonal to the element.\n \n      The wind speed sensors also measure wind direction, but with a\n      fourfold ambiguity.  Selection of the proper quadrant is\n      accomplished by a quadrant sensor, consisting of a heated\n      cylindrical platinum core (maintained at a 100 degrees Celsius\n      overheat) surrounded by four thermocouple junctions at equal\n      angles and distance from the core.  Thermocouples on opposite\n      sides of the post comprised a thermocouple pair which was\n      connected in series, allowing for measurement of the\n      temperature differences across each pair.  These differences\n      resulted from the thermal wake in the lee of the heated center\n      core.  The quadrant sensor values were functions, though not\n      single-valued, of wind speed.  The redundant wind speed and\n      directional information provided by both the wind speed and\n      quadrant sensors was combined using a least squares technique\n      to give the best estimates of wind speed and direction.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The scientific objectives of the Viking Meteorology Instrument\n      System (VMIS) are:\n \n      DETECTION OF MEDIUM- AND SMALL-SCALE SYSTEMS: The length scales\n      associated with convective processes (thermals, dust devils)\n      and mesoscale processes (fronts, small dust storms) are\n      considerably greater than the length scales that can be\n      measured by the Lander.  These atmospheric systems can be\n      detected and studied by the VMIS only when they pass the\n      Landers and then only if the VMIS is taking data at the time\n      the system passes.  It is an objective of the VMIS to measure\n      the passage of such systems and to study their structures.\n \n      MEASUREMENT OF SYNOPTIC- AND PLANETARY-SCALE SYSTEMS: With just\n      two observation points, it will not be possible to study the\n      structure of atmospheric systems on a planetary scale.  It will\n      be possible, however, to determine some parameters about the\n      general circulation that can provide useful constraints on\n      theory.  Examples are measurements of large-scale winds,\n      diurnal variations, and annual variations of atmospheric\n      conditions.\n \n      DETERMINATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYER:\n      An objective of the VMIS is to measure temperature, wind speed,\n      and wind direction in the turbulent boundary layer to\n      understand better the vertical transport of properties such as\n      momentum and heat throughout the diurnal cycle.\n \n      MEASUREMENT OF THE LOCAL ENVIORNMENT: It is an objective to\n      determine the meteorological environment in which the Landers\n      operate and how that environment varies diurnally, seasonally,\n      and annually.\n \n      SUPPORT OF OTHER EXPERIMENTS: Measurements made by VMIS may aid\n      in the analysis of data obtained by other Lander experiments.\n      For example, wind gusts can shake the Lander and cause spurious\n      signals to be generated by the seismometer.  Measurements of\n      wind speed and direction may aid in analyzing images of clouds\n      (dust and condensate), and temperature data will aid in\n      interpretation of observations of condensates.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Failure of the quadrant sensor on Lander 1 sol 45 (see\n      HESS_ETAL_1977) precludes unambiguous determination of wind\n      direction without modification to the analysis techniques and\n      software used to generate the wind direction data.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The Viking Meteorology Instrument System (VMIS), including\n      software, was subjected to an extensive test program at the\n      Langley Research Center.  The instrument was tested over the\n      anticipated range of Martian wind speeds (directions 0 to 360\n      degrees) and at temperatures as low as 200 degrees Kelvin.  The\n      data from these tests were reduced using the flight software,\n      and the results were compared to facility parameters that were\n      reduced independently.  These tests indicate that the VMIS\n      (including software, but not accounting for Lander flow-field\n      effects) has an accuracy of about 10% in wind speed, 10% in\n      wind direction, and 1.5 degree Kelvin in temperature.\n \n      The pressure transducers were calibrated to approximately 0.01\n      to 0.02 millibars accuracy over the ranges expected for martian\n      atmospheric pressure variation.  Calibrations to accuracies\n      greater than allowed by the digitizing system were accomplished\n      by test support instrumentation.  Repeatability from year to\n      year of the daily average pressures indicates that the\n      transducers have remained stable to significantly better than\n      0.04 millibars throughout the mission, possibly maintaining\n      stabilities on the order of 0.01 millibars.\n \n      It should be noted that the Meteorology Boom Assembly was\n      positioned on the Lander to minimize the effects of the\n      Lander-induced flow field.  The Lander effect is about 10% in\n      wind direction and 10% in wind speed and is a function of wind\n      direction and possibly local terrain.  Turbulence and other\n      effects will further contribute to instrument error.

Under ground command, the sampling rate, duration\n        over which a given sampling rate is maintained, the serial\n        sequence of sampling rates and duration, the time between\n        sampling sequences, the times and frequencies of sampling\n        initiation, and the total amount of data taken per martian\n        day (sol) can be varied.  Prior to landing, preplanned\n        sequences were loaded into each Lander.  These consisted of\n        modules with durations of of about 9, 20, and 39 minutes\n        spaced nominally 1.5 hours apart throughout the sol.\n        Intervals between individual samples were 4 and 8 seconds for\n        the 9 minute modules, 4 seconds for the 39 minute modules,\n        and 2 seconds for the 20 minute modules.  One complete\n        sequence consisted of 18 modules.  Sixteen of these were 9\n        minutes long and two, spaced about 12 hours apart, were of\n        longer duration (one being 39 minutes long, the other 20\n        minutes long).  The 18 periods were spaced so as to occupy\n        somewhat more than a sol.  As a result, the pattern of\n        sequences stepped ahead about 1.5 hours each sol.  This\n        survey mode was adopted in order to define the diurnal cycle\n        while moving long sequences through the sol, thus permitting\n        a study of fluctuation characteristics at all portions of the\n        diurnal cycle.\n \n        Later in the mission, extended periods of rapid sampling\n        (about 1 second intervals) were included to study boundary\n        layer characteristics at as high a sampling rate as the\n        system would allow.  In addition, various alterations were\n        made in sampling rates, durations, and measurement periods to\n        determine an optimal pattern for sampling the martian\n        atmosphere.  It became evident that the total science return\n        would be maximized by taking samples nearly continuously but\n        at rates slow enough to satisfy mission constraints on total\n        meteorology data.

The lander camera was a\n      facsimile camera with a single, stationary photosensor array\n      (PSA) and azimuth and elevation scanning mechanisms.  A lander\n      image was generated by scanning the scene in two directions\n      (azimuth and elevation) to focus light onto the photosensor\n      array.  A number of published papers described the\n      characteristics and performance of the lander cameras.  The\n      scientific rational and early design of the cameras were\n      described in Mutch et al.  [1972] and a detailed description of\n      the flight cameras was given in Huck et al. [1975b].  Huck and\n      Wall [1976] discussed image quality and Patterson et al.\n      [1977] described camera performance during the Primary Mission.\n      A summary of the information from these papers is given here as\n      a high-level description of the camera and its operating modes.\n \n \n    Platform Mounting Descriptions\n    ==============================\n      Each camera was bolted to the top of the lander body.  The\n      camera had a lower stationary section containing electronics\n      and an upper section that rotated in azimuth (i.e., around a\n      vertical axis).  The other prominent exterior component was a\n      post assembly that protected the camera window from the Mars\n      environment when the camera was not in use.  At the top of the\n      post was a carbon dioxide dust removal nozzle.  Major internal\n      camera components were two fused silica windows, a mirror,\n      elevation and azimuth rotation assemblies, a lens, the\n      photosensor array, electronics, and pinlights for calibration.\n      The overall camera height was 55.6 cm.  The lower assembly\n      diameter was 25.6 cm and the upper assembly diameter was 14.4\n      cm.  The weight of the camera was 7.26 kg.  Below is a table\n      that lists the serial number of the cameras and photosensor\n      arrays as they were assigned to the flight cameras [Huck et\n      al., 1975a].\n \n      Camera                  Serial Number  PSA Serial Number\n      --------------------------------------------------------\n      Viking 1, camera 1      FC-1B               M017\n \n      Viking 1, camera 2      FC-2A               M020\n \n      Viking 2, camera 1      FC-3A               M015\n \n      Viking 2, camera 2      SPARE               M019\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      The camera had several features to deal with possible dust\n      abrasion or obscuration.  When the camera was not in use, the\n      upper assembly was rotated so that the window was behind the\n      post assembly to prevent exposure to dust.  Mounted in the post\n      was a nozzle for releasing carbon dioxide gas to blow dust off\n      the window.  In addition, the outer window, known as the\n      contamination cover, was designed to move out of the optical\n      path if it became abraded or dust coated.  The contamination\n      cover window was hinged and spring loaded so that it could be\n      deployed by rotating the camera behind the post with enough\n      force to release the spring lever.  During the Extended Mission\n      the contamination cover windows of camera 1 on lander 1 and\n      camera 2 on lander 2 were deployed.  One drawback of the\n      contamination cover window was that its frame caused a\n      vignetting effect at elevation angles above 25 deg.  [Patterson\n      et al., 1977].\n \n      Light entered the camera through the windows, reflected off the\n      mirror toward the lens, passed through the lens, and was sensed\n      by one of the photodiodes.  A voltage was generated in the\n      selected photodiode that was digitized by an analog-to-digital\n      (A/D) converter.  Below the lens was a black shutter that could\n      be closed to sample photodiode dark current and to perform\n      internal radiometric calibration.  Between the lens and\n      photosensor array was a light baffle to minimize internal\n      reflections.  The lens had a 0.95 cm aperture diameter and 5.37\n      cm focal length.\n \n      Mechanical scanning was done by rotating the mirror around a\n      horizontal axis to scan each vertical line in an image.  The\n      entire upper camera assembly rotated around a vertical axis to\n      scan successive lines.  Image data were collected while the\n      mirror rotated up through the elevation range in 512 steps\n      (i.e., pixels were sampled from the bottom of the image to the\n      top).  The mirror rapidly rotated down to the start position\n      while the camera turned in azimuth for the next scan.  The\n      mirror could rotate from 60 deg below the horizon to 40 deg\n      above it for a total range of 100 deg.  The camera could see\n      342.5 deg in azimuth with the range limited by the post\n      assembly.  Image commands specified both a start and stop\n      azimuth such that the width of images varied.  On receiving a\n      command to acquire an image, the camera first rotated to a\n      preset azimuth and then rotated to the start azimuth.  The\n      camera stepped in azimuth after each vertical scan until the\n      stop azimuth was reached.  The sequence ended by the camera\n      moving back to the preset position and then to the park\n      position with the window behind the post.  The preset position\n      at the beginning and end of the sequence prevented the camera\n      from turning through mechanical stops.  Internal radiometric\n      calibration could be done by closing the shutter while the\n      camera was in the preset position either before or after the\n      image data were acquired.  The camera had two scanning rates so\n      that data could be collected at 250 or 16,000 bits/sec.\n \n      The photosensor array consisted of 12 silicon photodiodes (or\n      diodes) sensitive to light between 0.4 and 1.1 micrometers.\n      The diodes were arranged in a 2x6 array.  There were four broad\n      band, high resolution (0.04 deg angular resolution) diodes,\n      known as BB1, BB2, BB3, and BB4.  The distance between the lens\n      and each high resolution diode was different to vary the\n      in-focus distance of each diode.  In-focus distances were 1.9,\n      3.7, 4.5, and 13.3 meters for BB1, BB2, BB3, an BB4,\n      respectively.  There was a low resolution (0.12 deg angular\n      resolution), broad band diode known as the SURVEY diode.  There\n      were also six narrow band, low resolution diodes for color\n      (BLUE, GREEN, and RED) and infrared (IR1, IR2, and IR3) images.\n      The narrow bandwidth was generated by covering diodes with a\n      set of interference filters, chosen to survive the spacecraft\n      sterilization process.  The interference filters had\n      significant out-of-band leaks.  Also, the infrared filters were\n      known to degrade due to neutron radiation from the lander RTGs\n      [Patterson et al., 1977].  The twelfth diode was also a low\n      resolution diode covered by a red filter for imaging the Sun.\n      The in-focus distance for the low resolution diodes was about\n      3.7 meters.\n \n      Diodes in the camera generated a voltage proportional to\n      incoming radiance.  Each diode, except for the SUN diode, had\n      an amplifier to enhance the voltage signal.  The SUN diode did\n      not need an amplifier because of the strong signal when\n      directly viewing the Sun.  Voltage from the amplifier was\n      digitized as a 6-bit number in an A/D converter that also\n      performed automatic dark current subtraction.  Dark current was\n      sampled after every line in slow scan mode and after every 64th\n      line in rapid scan mode.  The A/D converter had 6 gains and 32\n      offsets so that the full dynamic range of the diode output\n      could be stored in 6-bits.  Gain defined the voltage range\n      sampled and its resolution.  Low gain (high gain number)\n      covered a wide range in voltage and had low voltage resolution.\n      The offset could be varied from a slightly negative voltage to\n      several volts in 32 small steps.  Digital values from the A/D\n      converter could be dumped to the spacecraft tape recorder or\n      transmitted to Earth or an orbiter in real-time (usually done\n      at beginning or end of a transmission link when the bit error\n      rate was relatively high).\n \n      Each camera had two pinlights in the post assembly.  Using a\n      special command, the lights turned on and an image was acquired\n      while viewing the pinlights.  This command, known as a scan\n      verification, monitored the mechanical scanning operation of\n      the camera.  A third pinlight with four different radiance\n      levels was located between the dark current shutter and the\n      photosensor array.  This pinlight was used with the shutter\n      closed for radiometric calibration of the camera.\n \n \n    Operation and Sampling Modes\n    ============================\n      Operation of Viking Lander cameras was versatile in that many\n      parameters for the image could be specified.  Commands to\n      acquire an image involved selecting the sampling mode, diode,\n      start and stop azimuths, center elevation, gain and offset,\n      scan rate, and specifying whether automatic dark current\n      subtraction, internal calibration, rescan, or dusting were\n      done.  Image start time and whether the image was transmitted\n      in real-time or sent to the tape recorder were also specified.\n \n      The camera had seven sampling modes: low resolution (0.12 deg)\n      stepping with three diodes (known as triplet mode); low\n      resolution stepping with one diode; high resolution (0.04 deg)\n      stepping with one diode; and four different calibration lamp\n      intensity levels.  In triplet mode, elevation scanning was\n      repeated three times with three different diodes at every\n      azimuth position.  An unusual sampling mode effect was an\n      elevation shift when the step size did not match the diode\n      resolution.  There was a -5.6 deg elevation shift when using a\n      low resolution diode with high resolution stepping and a +5.6\n      deg shift when using a high resolution diode with low\n      resolution stepping.  These non-nominal modes were mostly used\n      to generate high resolution color images or to better resolve\n      the solar disk.  For the triplet mode, the specified diode was\n      the first of the three diodes, e.g., BLUE diode for a color\n      image.

The lander camera was a\n      facsimile camera with a single, stationary photosensor array\n      (PSA) and azimuth and elevation scanning mechanisms.  A lander\n      image was generated by scanning the scene in two directions\n      (azimuth and elevation) to focus light onto the photosensor\n      array.  A number of published papers described the\n      characteristics and performance of the lander cameras.  The\n      scientific rational and early design of the cameras were\n      described in Mutch et al.  [1972] and a detailed description of\n      the flight cameras was given in Huck et al. [1975b].  Huck and\n      Wall [1976] discussed image quality and Patterson et al.\n      [1977] described camera performance during the Primary Mission.\n      A summary of the information from these papers is given here as\n      a high-level description of the camera and its operating modes.\n \n \n    Platform Mounting Descriptions\n    ==============================\n      Each camera was bolted to the top of the lander body.  The\n      camera had a lower stationary section containing electronics\n      and an upper section that rotated in azimuth (i.e., around a\n      vertical axis).  The other prominent exterior component was a\n      post assembly that protected the camera window from the Mars\n      environment when the camera was not in use.  At the top of the\n      post was a carbon dioxide dust removal nozzle.  Major internal\n      camera components were two fused silica windows, a mirror,\n      elevation and azimuth rotation assemblies, a lens, the\n      photosensor array, electronics, and pinlights for calibration.\n      The overall camera height was 55.6 cm.  The lower assembly\n      diameter was 25.6 cm and the upper assembly diameter was 14.4\n      cm.  The weight of the camera was 7.26 kg.  Below is a table\n      that lists the serial number of the cameras and photosensor\n      arrays as they were assigned to the flight cameras [Huck et\n      al., 1975a].\n \n      Camera                  Serial Number  PSA Serial Number\n      --------------------------------------------------------\n      Viking 1, camera 1      FC-1B               M017\n \n      Viking 1, camera 2      FC-2A               M020\n \n      Viking 2, camera 1      FC-3A               M015\n \n      Viking 2, camera 2      SPARE               M019\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      The camera had several features to deal with possible dust\n      abrasion or obscuration.  When the camera was not in use, the\n      upper assembly was rotated so that the window was behind the\n      post assembly to prevent exposure to dust.  Mounted in the post\n      was a nozzle for releasing carbon dioxide gas to blow dust off\n      the window.  In addition, the outer window, known as the\n      contamination cover, was designed to move out of the optical\n      path if it became abraded or dust coated.  The contamination\n      cover window was hinged and spring loaded so that it could be\n      deployed by rotating the camera behind the post with enough\n      force to release the spring lever.  During the Extended Mission\n      the contamination cover windows of camera 1 on lander 1 and\n      camera 2 on lander 2 were deployed.  One drawback of the\n      contamination cover window was that its frame caused a\n      vignetting effect at elevation angles above 25 deg.  [Patterson\n      et al., 1977].\n \n      Light entered the camera through the windows, reflected off the\n      mirror toward the lens, passed through the lens, and was sensed\n      by one of the photodiodes.  A voltage was generated in the\n      selected photodiode that was digitized by an analog-to-digital\n      (A/D) converter.  Below the lens was a black shutter that could\n      be closed to sample photodiode dark current and to perform\n      internal radiometric calibration.  Between the lens and\n      photosensor array was a light baffle to minimize internal\n      reflections.  The lens had a 0.95 cm aperture diameter and 5.37\n      cm focal length.\n \n      Mechanical scanning was done by rotating the mirror around a\n      horizontal axis to scan each vertical line in an image.  The\n      entire upper camera assembly rotated around a vertical axis to\n      scan successive lines.  Image data were collected while the\n      mirror rotated up through the elevation range in 512 steps\n      (i.e., pixels were sampled from the bottom of the image to the\n      top).  The mirror rapidly rotated down to the start position\n      while the camera turned in azimuth for the next scan.  The\n      mirror could rotate from 60 deg below the horizon to 40 deg\n      above it for a total range of 100 deg.  The camera could see\n      342.5 deg in azimuth with the range limited by the post\n      assembly.  Image commands specified both a start and stop\n      azimuth such that the width of images varied.  On receiving a\n      command to acquire an image, the camera first rotated to a\n      preset azimuth and then rotated to the start azimuth.  The\n      camera stepped in azimuth after each vertical scan until the\n      stop azimuth was reached.  The sequence ended by the camera\n      moving back to the preset position and then to the park\n      position with the window behind the post.  The preset position\n      at the beginning and end of the sequence prevented the camera\n      from turning through mechanical stops.  Internal radiometric\n      calibration could be done by closing the shutter while the\n      camera was in the preset position either before or after the\n      image data were acquired.  The camera had two scanning rates so\n      that data could be collected at 250 or 16,000 bits/sec.\n \n      The photosensor array consisted of 12 silicon photodiodes (or\n      diodes) sensitive to light between 0.4 and 1.1 micrometers.\n      The diodes were arranged in a 2x6 array.  There were four broad\n      band, high resolution (0.04 deg angular resolution) diodes,\n      known as BB1, BB2, BB3, and BB4.  The distance between the lens\n      and each high resolution diode was different to vary the\n      in-focus distance of each diode.  In-focus distances were 1.9,\n      3.7, 4.5, and 13.3 meters for BB1, BB2, BB3, an BB4,\n      respectively.  There was a low resolution (0.12 deg angular\n      resolution), broad band diode known as the SURVEY diode.  There\n      were also six narrow band, low resolution diodes for color\n      (BLUE, GREEN, and RED) and infrared (IR1, IR2, and IR3) images.\n      The narrow bandwidth was generated by covering diodes with a\n      set of interference filters, chosen to survive the spacecraft\n      sterilization process.  The interference filters had\n      significant out-of-band leaks.  Also, the infrared filters were\n      known to degrade due to neutron radiation from the lander RTGs\n      [Patterson et al., 1977].  The twelfth diode was also a low\n      resolution diode covered by a red filter for imaging the Sun.\n      The in-focus distance for the low resolution diodes was about\n      3.7 meters.\n \n      Diodes in the camera generated a voltage proportional to\n      incoming radiance.  Each diode, except for the SUN diode, had\n      an amplifier to enhance the voltage signal.  The SUN diode did\n      not need an amplifier because of the strong signal when\n      directly viewing the Sun.  Voltage from the amplifier was\n      digitized as a 6-bit number in an A/D converter that also\n      performed automatic dark current subtraction.  Dark current was\n      sampled after every line in slow scan mode and after every 64th\n      line in rapid scan mode.  The A/D converter had 6 gains and 32\n      offsets so that the full dynamic range of the diode output\n      could be stored in 6-bits.  Gain defined the voltage range\n      sampled and its resolution.  Low gain (high gain number)\n      covered a wide range in voltage and had low voltage resolution.\n      The offset could be varied from a slightly negative voltage to\n      several volts in 32 small steps.  Digital values from the A/D\n      converter could be dumped to the spacecraft tape recorder or\n      transmitted to Earth or an orbiter in real-time (usually done\n      at beginning or end of a transmission link when the bit error\n      rate was relatively high).\n \n      Each camera had two pinlights in the post assembly.  Using a\n      special command, the lights turned on and an image was acquired\n      while viewing the pinlights.  This command, known as a scan\n      verification, monitored the mechanical scanning operation of\n      the camera.  A third pinlight with four different radiance\n      levels was located between the dark current shutter and the\n      photosensor array.  This pinlight was used with the shutter\n      closed for radiometric calibration of the camera.\n \n \n    Operation and Sampling Modes\n    ============================\n      Operation of Viking Lander cameras was versatile in that many\n      parameters for the image could be specified.  Commands to\n      acquire an image involved selecting the sampling mode, diode,\n      start and stop azimuths, center elevation, gain and offset,\n      scan rate, and specifying whether automatic dark current\n      subtraction, internal calibration, rescan, or dusting were\n      done.  Image start time and whether the image was transmitted\n      in real-time or sent to the tape recorder were also specified.\n \n      The camera had seven sampling modes: low resolution (0.12 deg)\n      stepping with three diodes (known as triplet mode); low\n      resolution stepping with one diode; high resolution (0.04 deg)\n      stepping with one diode; and four different calibration lamp\n      intensity levels.  In triplet mode, elevation scanning was\n      repeated three times with three different diodes at every\n      azimuth position.  An unusual sampling mode effect was an\n      elevation shift when the step size did not match the diode\n      resolution.  There was a -5.6 deg elevation shift when using a\n      low resolution diode with high resolution stepping and a +5.6\n      deg shift when using a high resolution diode with low\n      resolution stepping.  These non-nominal modes were mostly used\n      to generate high resolution color images or to better resolve\n      the solar disk.  For the triplet mode, the specified diode was\n      the first of the three diodes, e.g., BLUE diode for a color\n      image.  Start and stop azimuths had to be multiples of 2.5 deg.\n      Center elevation had to be a multiple of 10 deg.  The elevation\n      range was determined by the step size with a range of about 20\n      deg for high resolution and about 60 deg for low resolution\n      since there was always 512 steps in an elevation scan.  Rescan\n      was done by inhibiting the azimuth rotation and repeatedly\n      scanning in elevation.  Rescan could be activated by commanding\n      the camera to operate for a time longer then it took to scan\n      the azimuth range of the image.\n \n \n    Principal Investigator\n    ======================\n      The principal investigator for the Viking Lander imaging system\n      during instrument development and the Viking Primary Mission\n      was Thomas A.  Mutch of Brown University.  From the Extended\n      Mission until the end of the Viking Mission, Raymond E.\n      Arvidson of Washington University was the lander imaging\n      principal investigator.","tools":[]},{"tags":["Spectrometer"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mawd.vo1","display_name":"Viking Orbiter 1 Mars Atmospheric Water Detector","display_description":"INSTRUMENT: MARS ATMOSPHERIC WATER DETECTOR\n    SPACECRAFT: VIKING ORBITER 1\n \n \n    Instrument Information\n    ======================\n      Instrument Id                  : MAWD\n      Instrument Host Id             : VO1\n      Pi Pds User Id                 : CBFARMER\n      Instrument Name                : MARS ATMOSPHERIC WATER\n                                         DETECTOR\n      Instrument Type                : UNK\n      Build Date                     : UNK\n      Instrument Mass                : UNK\n      Instrument Length              : UNK\n      Instrument Width               : UNK\n      Instrument Height              : UNK\n      Instrument Serial Number       : UNK\n      Instrument Manufacturer Name   : JET PROPULSION LABORATORY\n \n \n    Instrument Description\n    ======================\n      This experiment was designed to measure the absorption of solar\n      radiation by the strong lines at the center of the 1.4\n      micrometer (7200 cm**-1) combination vibration-rotation bands\n      of water vapor.  The MAWD instrument is a fixed grating\n      spectrometer having five channels centered on three absorption\n      lines and two continuum regions between these lines.  All\n      channels utilize PbS detectors; the spectral resolution of each\n      is about 1.2 cm**-1.  The instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of\n      the detectors is 0.96 by 0.12 degree.  The IFOV can be\n      step-scanned perpendicular to its long dimension through\n      fifteen positions by a raster mirror incorporated in the\n      optical train.  The time spent at each step (approximately the\n      signal integration time) is 280 milliseconds, and the duration\n      of the raster is 4.48 seconds.  The combination of the motions\n      of the raster mirror, the orbiter scan platform, and the\n      orbital ground track generates sets of slew patterns over the\n      planet's surface.

The second objective is\n      concerned with the nature of the water vapor cycle itself and\n      the relationship between the martian atmospheric and surface or\n      subsurface water.  To this end, the observations are designed\n      to investigate spatial, diurnal, and seasonal variations of\n      water vapor with high spatial and temporal resolutions.

Motion of the neon lamp exit plane image with\n      respect to the silicon reference detectors is sensed and used\n      to drive a cam which repositions the grating to preserve the\n      correct wavelength alignment.  The channel responses are\n      corrected by means of periodic calibrations made by inserting a\n      mirror into the input beam so that the detectors view a\n      sunlight-illuminated diffusely

The camera system is commonly called the Visual\n      Imaging Subsystem (VIS).  Each camera consists of a telescope,\n      a slow scan vidicon, a filter wheel, and associated\n      electronics.  The filter wheel contains blue, minus blue,\n      violet, clear, green, and red filters.  The angular field of\n      view as defined by the reseau pattern is 1.51 by 1.69 degrees.\n      Since the scan lines go beyond the reseau pattern in the line\n      direction the active field of view is about 1.54 degrees in\n      this direction.  The actual ground area covered by an image\n      varies as a function of spacecraft altitude and emission angle.\n      The digital image is generated by scanning the vidicon face\n      plate.  The signal is digitized as a 7-bit number.  The image\n      contains 1056 horizontal lines.  There are 1182 samples in each\n      line exposed to incoming light.  The vidicon samples 11 pixels\n      on either side of the raster onto an opaque mask located at the\n      front of each vidicon.  Hence, 1204 samples per line are\n      telemetered to Earth, but only 1182 contain information.  Each\n      camera can be commanded to acquire an image every 8.96 seconds.\n      By alternating cameras, an image can be taken every 4.48\n      seconds.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The first objective of the imaging system was to characterize\n      potential landing sites in support of site selection.\n      Additional objectives of the imaging system were to study the\n      photometric and colorimetric properties of the surface\n      discovered by Mariner 9 in order to better understand the\n      geological history of Mars atmosphere.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Each Viking Orbiter camera contained a filter wheel with five\n      filters and a clear position, i.e., no filter.  An image could\n      be acquired using one of the six filters types, which included\n      blue, minus blue, violet, clear, green, and red.  The filter\n      wheel could be stepped only one position between each exposure.\n      Three mode parameters or camera states could be set for a given\n      exposure.  There was the light flood condition flag.  Light\n      flooding was used to reduce the residual image from the\n      previous exposure.  Eight small incandescent bulbs exposed the\n      vidicon beyond saturation.  There were also two gain states:\n      low and high.  The high gain state increased the gain by a\n      factor of 2.  There was also an exposure offset that would\n      provide a positive signal (DN) from the camera even for a zero\n      exposure.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal\n      received from the camera (DN value) into a quantity that is\n      proportional to the radiance reaching the sensor.  The\n      sensitivity of the vidicon varies across the field of view.\n      The sensitivity of the vidicon also varies with time.  Each\n      Viking Orbiter imaging instrument was calibrated before flight.\n      In addition, changes in the calibration over time have been\n      estimated from analyses of images of deep space and dust\n      storms.  The radiometric calibration applies additive and\n      multiplicative corrections that account for the varying\n      sensitivity of the vidicon.  The resulting values are\n      proportional to radiance factor, which is defined as the ratio\n      of the observed radiance to the radiance of a normally\n      illuminated lambertian reflector of unit reflectance at the\n      same heliocentric distance.  The geometric calibration removes\n      electronic distortions and transforms the point perspective\n      geometry of the original image into a map projection.  The\n      electronic distortions are barrel- shaped distortions from the\n      electron beam readout and complex distortions from interactions\n      between the charge on the vidicon face plate and the electron\n      beam.  The electronic distortions are modeled by comparing the\n      undistorted locations of reseau marks with the actual locations\n      in an image.\n \n \n    Section 'VISA'\n    ==============\n      Total Fovs                     : 1\n      Data Rate                      : 2112000.000000\n      Sample Bits                    : 7\n \n \n      'VISA' Detectors\n      ----------------\n        VISA\n \n \n      'VISA' Electronics\n      ------------------\n        VISA\n \n \n      'VISA' Filters\n      --------------\n        BLUE\n        CLEAR\n        GREEN\n        MINUS BLUE\n        RED\n        VIOLET\n \n \n      'VISA' Section Optic IDs\n      ------------------------\n        VISA\n \n \n      In modes\n      --------\n        ...\n        ..D\n        .G.\n        .GD\n        L..\n        L.D\n        LG.\n        LGD\n \n \n      'VISA' Section FOV Shape 'RECTANGULAR'\n      --------------------------------------\n        Section Id                     : VISA\n        Fovs                           : 1\n        Horizontal Pixel Fov           : 0.001420\n        Vertical Pixel Fov             : 0.001420\n        Horizontal Fov                 : 1.693000\n        Vertical Fov                   : 1.540000\n \n \n      'VISA' Section Parameter 'RADIANCE'\n      -----------------------------------\n        Radiance is the amount of energy per time per projected area\n        per steradian.\n \n        Instrument Parameter Name      : RADIANCE\n        Sampling Parameter Name        : PIXEL\n        Instrument Parameter Unit      : WATT/(METER*METER)/STERADIAN\n        Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 0.001420\n        Sampling Parameter Unit        : DEGREE\n \n \n    Instrument Detector 'VISA'\n    ==========================\n      Detector Type                  : VIDICON\n      Detector Aspect Ratio          : 1.120000\n      Minimum Wavelength             : 0.350000\n      Maximum Wavelength             : 0.650000\n      Nominal Operating Temperature  : 288.000000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The VIS detector is a Westinghouse 5166 selenium vidicon.

The camera system is commonly called the Visual\n      Imaging Subsystem (VIS).  Each camera consists of a telescope,\n      a slow scan vidicon, a filter wheel, and associated\n      electronics.  The filter wheel contains blue, minus blue,\n      violet, clear, green, and red filters.  The angular field of\n      view as defined by the reseau pattern is 1.51 by 1.69 degrees.\n      Since the scan lines go beyond the reseau pattern in the line\n      direction the active field of view is about 1.54 degrees in\n      this direction.  The actual ground area covered by an image\n      varies as a function of spacecraft altitude and emission angle.\n      The digital image is generated by scanning the vidicon face\n      plate.  The signal is digitized as a 7-bit number.  The image\n      contains 1056 horizontal lines.  There are 1182 samples in each\n      line exposed to incoming light.  The vidicon samples 11 pixels\n      on either side of the raster onto an opaque mask located at the\n      front of each vidicon.  Hence, 1204 samples per line are\n      telemetered to Earth, but only 1182 contain information.  Each\n      camera can be commanded to acquire an image every 8.96 seconds.\n      By alternating cameras, an image can be taken every 4.48\n      seconds.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The first objective of the imaging system was to characterize\n      potential landing sites in support of site selection.\n      Additional objectives of the imaging system were to study the\n      photometric and colorimetric properties of the surface\n      discovered by Mariner 9 in order to better understand the\n      geological history of Mars atmosphere.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Each Viking Orbiter camera contained a filter wheel with five\n      filters and a clear position, i.e., no filter.  An image could\n      be acquired using one of the six filters types, which included\n      blue, minus blue, violet, clear, green, and red.  The filter\n      wheel could be stepped only one position between each exposure.\n      Three mode parameters or camera states could be set for a given\n      exposure.  There was the light flood condition flag.  Light\n      flooding was used to reduce the residual image from the\n      previous exposure.  Eight small incandescent bulbs exposed the\n      vidicon beyond saturation.  There were also two gain states:\n      low and high.  The high gain state increased the gain by a\n      factor of 2.  There was also an exposure offset that would\n      provide a positive signal (DN) from the camera even for a zero\n      exposure.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal\n      received from the camera (DN value) into a quantity that is\n      proportional to the radiance reaching the sensor.  The\n      sensitivity of the vidicon varies across the field of view.\n      The sensitivity of the vidicon also varies with time.  Each\n      Viking Orbiter imaging instrument was calibrated before flight.\n      In addition, changes in the calibration over time have been\n      estimated from analyses of images of deep space and dust\n      storms.  The radiometric calibration applies additive and\n      multiplicative corrections that account for the varying\n      sensitivity of the vidicon.  The resulting values are\n      proportional to radiance factor, which is defined as the ratio\n      of the observed radiance to the radiance of a normally\n      illuminated lambertian reflector of unit reflectance at the\n      same heliocentric distance.  The geometric calibration removes\n      electronic distortions and transforms the point perspective\n      geometry of the original image into a map projection.  The\n      electronic distortions are barrel- shaped distortions from the\n      electron beam readout and complex distortions from interactions\n      between the charge on the vidicon face plate and the electron\n      beam.  The electronic distortions are modeled by comparing the\n      undistorted locations of reseau marks with the actual locations\n      in an image.\n \n \n    Section 'VISB'\n    ==============\n      Total Fovs                     : 1\n      Data Rate                      : 2112000.000000\n      Sample Bits                    : 7\n \n \n      'VISB' Detectors\n      ----------------\n        VISB\n \n \n      'VISB' Electronics\n      ------------------\n        VISB\n \n \n      'VISB' Filters\n      --------------\n        BLUE\n        CLEAR\n        GREEN\n        MINUS BLUE\n        RED\n        VIOLET\n \n \n      'VISB' Section Optic IDs\n      ------------------------\n        VISB\n \n \n      In modes\n      --------\n        ...\n        ..D\n        .G.\n        .GD\n        L..\n        L.D\n        LG.\n        LGD\n \n \n      'VISB' Section FOV Shape 'RECTANGULAR'\n      --------------------------------------\n        Section Id                     : VISB\n        Fovs                           : 1\n        Horizontal Pixel Fov           : 0.001420\n        Vertical Pixel Fov             : 0.001420\n        Horizontal Fov                 : 1.692000\n        Vertical Fov                   : 1.533000\n \n \n      'VISB' Section Parameter 'RADIANCE'\n      -----------------------------------\n        Radiance is the amount of energy per time per projected area\n        per steradian.\n \n        Instrument Parameter Name      : RADIANCE\n        Sampling Parameter Name        : PIXEL\n        Instrument Parameter Unit      : WATT/(METER*METER)/STERADIAN\n        Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 0.001420\n        Sampling Parameter Unit        : DEGREE\n \n \n    Instrument Detector 'VISB'\n    ==========================\n      Detector Type                  : VIDICON\n      Detector Aspect Ratio          : 1.120000\n      Minimum Wavelength             : 0.350000\n      Maximum Wavelength             : 0.650000\n      Nominal Operating Temperature  : 288.000000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The VIS detector is a Westinghouse 5166 selenium vidicon.

There is a total of\n      twenty-eight channels in four surface and one atmospheric\n      thermal band from 6 micrometer to 30 micrometer and a broad\n      solar reflectance band.  All channels are sampled\n      simultaneously, using the spacecraft scanning capability to map\n      the radiance over small and large areas of the planet.  All\n      channels use thermopile detectors; spectral passbands are\n      determined by a combination of interference filters, detector\n      lens materials, antireflection coatings, and reststrahlen\n      optics.  The scan modes are described in the PDS INSTRUMENT\n      MODE DESCRIPTION.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The objective of the Viking Orbiter infrared thermal mapper\n      (IRTM) is to measure the thermal emission of the Martian\n      surface and atmosphere and total reflected sunlight with high\n      spatial and flux resolution.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Most low and moderate resolution IRTM data were acquired\n      through using 'box scans'.  These were commonly acquired\n      between 1-6 hours from periapsis, and utilized the scan\n      platform to slew back and forth in cone angle (in the direction\n      the IRTM chevron points) with small offsets in the same\n      direction between these oscillating slews.  Ignoring spacecraft\n      motion, this pattern would generate bi-directional evenly\n      spaced scans with the seven IRTM detectors.  Spacecraft motion\n      during the scan sequence, typically of 10-40 minutes duration,\n      created some distortion in this otherwise uniform pattern.\n      Typical resulting scans across the planetary surface are shown\n      in Figure 3 of Kieffer et al., 1976.  These scans were usually\n      designed to extend slightly off the limb of the planet on at\n      least one side.  These 'planet port' off-planet data provided\n      the best estimates of the zero radiance response of the\n      instrument.  When the spacecraft was near periapsis, the\n      apparent motion of the planetary surface relative to the\n      spacecraft was too rapid to allow oscillating slews.  At these\n      times, the instrument would simply 'stare' in one direction and\n      use the spacecraft motion to sweep the detector pattern across\n      the surface.  These observations were usually acquired in\n      Normal Mode, but occasionally Fixed Planet was used.  At\n      irregular times through the mission, 'phase function'\n      observations were made.  These involved using the two axis scan\n      platform to follow one point on the ground as the spacecraft\n      went from horizon to horizon relative to this surface point.\n      In actuality, this sequence was acquired using a small number\n      of discrete scan platform moves, allowing the instrument to\n      'stare' across a short stripe centered on the target point\n      between slews.  Such 'phase function' observations typically\n      yielded about 10 different viewing geometries within a single\n      sequence.  These observations were particularly useful in\n      determining the influence of the atmosphere.  In preparation of\n      the IRTM data set, all observations which were more than 1 1/2\n      degrees apparent angle above the nearest limb of the planet\n      were deleted.\n \n      Geometry Errors Due to Uncertain Timing: Early and late during\n      the Viking mission, orbital solutions based on the tracking\n      telemetry were determined every few days.  During VO-1\n      revolution 175-603 and VO-2 revolutions 118-521, orbital\n      solutions were often separated by a week or more.  Because\n      there is significant irregularity in the Martian gravitional\n      field, these irregularities could slowly influence the orbit of\n      the Viking spacecraft in unpredictable ways.  The primary\n      influence was in the period of the orbit, resulting in\n      uncertainty as to exactly where the spacecraft was along its\n      orbit at any specific time.  These uncertainties were as large\n      as 75 seconds in the worst case.  Far from periapsis, these\n      timing uncertainties were not of major significance because the\n      spacecraft velocities were low and the projected fields of\n      views on the planet were large.  However, near periapsis, the\n      IRTM field of view could move across the surface equivalent to\n      its full width in as little as one second.  Thus, when there\n      was a large timing error, the computed ground intercept\n      locations could be in error by many fields of view.  In the\n      worst case, these positions may be in error by up to 200 km.\n      When the magnitude of this problem was discovered, the SEDR\n      (geometry calculations) for the imaging instrument was rerun\n      with revised orbit solutions.  However, it was impractical to\n      regenerate the IRTM SEDR and these errors have not been\n      corrected.  There was an attempt by the navigational team to\n      estimate the magnitude of the timing error for both Viking\n      spacecraft for those revolutions through the affected part of\n      the Viking mission.  This is described in the 1980 April 14\n      memo by Frank Palluconi, which contains estimates of the\n      magnitude of the error for each revolution.  Hugh Kieffer has a\n      copy (the sole surviving copy?) of this memo.  A direct\n      determination of the timing offset can be made from the IRTM\n      data alone in those instances when thermal patterns can be\n      unambiguously identified with surface features.  Since the\n      dominant geometric error is in time, maps of thermal patterns\n      (typically as contours of observed temperature minus the\n      calculated standard model temperature) can be slid across the\n      cartographic map parallel to the subspacecraft track (if the\n      instrument was in fixed planet mode, this is simply sliding the\n      IRTM trace along its own path) until the thermal and\n      cartographic features are aligned.  Because there are small\n      gaps in the IRTM coverage every 64 ICKs, the amount the IRTM\n      pattern must be shifted to agree with the surface morphology\n      can be scaled directly into a timing offset in seconds.  This\n      has been done for a variety of high resolution scans across\n      Arsia Mons (by Jim Zimbelman) and for many scans across Valles\n      Marineris (by David Paige and Hugh Kieffer).  A set of known\n      offsets is slowly accumulating.  Hugh Kieffer has a copy (the\n      sole surviving copy?) of the memo discussing this problem.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      Relative spectral response of all channels was measured end to\n      end using a Perkin-Elmer 16 U monochrometer with appropriate\n      gratings and order filters.  A globar at 1400 K was used in the\n      2-25 micrometer range; shortward of 2.0 micrometers a tungsten\n      source at 2700 K was used.  The reference detector was a\n      thermocouple for all but the 0.4-1.1 micrometer range, where a\n      calibrated silicon photodiode was used.  Out-of-band\n      measurements were made by replacing the spectrometer grating\n      with a plane mirror and ir materials having known cutoff and\n      cuton wavelengths.  Flux calibration of the IRTM was performed\n      under a simulated space environment using a vacuum chamber\n      operated typically at a pressure of 1.E-6 Torr.  The IRTM was\n      operated by means of a console which simulated the interfaces\n      and functions of the spacecraft FDS.  A minicomputer was used\n      to provide all operational sequences and modes.  Data were\n      recorded on magnetic tape for subsequent computer processing.\n      The calibration fixture consisted of two identical blackbodies,\n      one located in front of the space port and maintained at liquid\n      nitrogen temperature and the other in front of the planet port\n      and adjustable in temperature from 77 K to 350K; eleven\n      settings from 140 K to 330 K were used.  Blackbody temperatures\n      were measured with platinum resistance thermometers having an\n      absolute accuracy of +/- 0.1 degrees C.  traceable to the\n      National Bureau of Standards.  The digitizer used in the test\n      console provided ten times the resolution of the FDS digitizer,\n      thus making the digitizing uncertainty during calibration\n      insignificant compared to the noise.  The calibration data thus\n      produced are IRTM output in digitization level (DN) as a\n      function of blackbody temperature.  Radiometrically measured\n      internal reference surface temperatures showed close agreement\n      (+/- 0.5 degrees C.) with those measured independently with a\n      thermister.  The IRTM temperature was controlled by regulating\n      the temperature of a mounting base plate and the thermal shield\n      inside the vacuum chamber.  Calibration was performed at 10\n      degrees C.  spacing across the range of operating temperatures\n      expected during flight.  Typical IRTM channel response to scene\n      brightness temperatures is shown in Fig.  8 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n      The one-sample noise on the thermal channels is less than 1 DN\n      except for the 15 micrometer channel where it is about 2.5 DN.\n      The dynamic ranges of the surface thermal bands are based on\n      temperatures expected for the Martian surface.  The 300 K\n      maximum chosen for the A telescope might be exceeded by midday\n      summer temperatures, but temperatures above the 310-K limit of\n      the B telescope should not be exceeded unless active volcanic\n      areas were found; temperatures to 320 K and 330 K could be\n      measured by the 9 micrometer and 7 micrometer bands.  The 15\n      micrometer band dynamic range was set quite large as its\n      resolution is noise limited rather than digitization limited.\n      Telescope D channels were calibrated using a different method.\n      The radiance source was a mercury-xenon lamp and narrowband\n      filter centered at 0.896 micrometer with a bandwidth of 425 nm.\n      The in-band radiance of the lamp was known by direct comparison\n      with a standard lamp acquired from the National Bureau of\n      Standards, using a silicon photodiode as a transfer standard.\n      The relative spectral response measurements then allowed\n      extension of the one-point absolute calibration to the entire\n      passband.  Gains for the D channels were set to give full scale\n      for 75% of the diffuse reflection of solar irradiance at Mars\n      average distance from the sun.  Using integrals of the Planck\n      function and the measured spectral response, the flux response\n      of the IRTM is found to be close to linear in the thermal\n      channels.  The best fit quadratic functions, normalized to full\n      scale, typically had constant and quadratic coefficients of\n      0.002 and 0.02, respectively.  The solar band channels, which\n      had much higher absolute flux levels at full scale, showed a\n      decrease in response at high signal levels corresponding to a\n      quadratic coefficient of 0.07.  With the IRTM in the vacuum\n      chamber, the instrument response was measured at four lamp\n      currents.  An additional series of wide band measurements\n      utilizing a NBS standard lamp and a barium sulfate diffusing\n      screen, in which only the lamp-screen distance was changed, was\n      used to determine in detail the solar band nonlinearity.\n      During spacecraft thermal-vacuum testing and in flight, a small\n      drift of about 1-min duration was found to be induced when the\n      scan mirror moved to the reference position in normal mode.\n      This appears to be caused by the decrease in radiative heat\n      loss from the instrument when the telescopes do not view space.\n      The shape of this postreference drift was accurately determined\n      during normal mode sequences when the spacecraft was well away\n      from Mars, and this effect is removed in the data reduction.\n      The change of the thermal state of the IRTM caused by large\n      scan platform slew or planetary radiation near periapsis can\n      introduce significant drifts of the zero-flux level.  These\n      shifts have a time constant of 1-2 min or longer, and their\n      magnitude increases with inband wavelength and preamplifier\n      gain.  It is probably due primarily to very small temperature\n      gradients induced in the detector packages as the general\n      instrument temperature changes.  A significant design feature\n      of the IRTM is that the space DN level of each channel is\n      measured immediately prior to and after the restore which\n      occurs each minute in normal mode.  A linear interpolation\n      between these zero-flux DN levels is used in data\n      decalibration.

The\n        chevron arrangement was based on the need for uniform\n        coverage irrespective of scan platform orientation; it also\n        allowed the detectors to all be approximately the same\n        distance from the telescope optic axis.  In this application\n        thermopiles were found to be better than other thermal\n        detectors because they operate to dc and exhibit no 1/f\n        noise.  Thus, no optical chopper is needed.  Also, no bias\n        supply, another potential source of 1/f noise, is needed.\n        Cooled quantum detectors were not practical, considering the\n        duration and weight constraints of the Viking Mission.  The\n        array was made by evaporating the various components onto a\n        sapphire film using photoetched masks for dimensional\n        control.  The film, about 200 nm thick, is supported by a\n        sapphire disk.  The film was made by anodizing aluminum foil\n        and etching away the aluminum.  The black circular dots in\n        the figure are the sensitive areas overlaid with bismuth\n        mass.

At\n        other times the detector packages were backfilled with xenon\n        to protect the detectors while still allowing gross\n        sensitivity checks.  To avoid exposure to moisture during the\n        long period prior to launch when the IRTM was mounted on the\n        spacecraft and could not be sealed, the manifold was kept at\n        a slight positive pressure by a continuous flow of high\n        purity nitrogen.  The manifold was opened to space by launch\n        vehicle separation.\n \n \n      Sensitivity\n      -----------\n        The detectivity is 2.E8 CM_HZ**0.5_W**-1\n \n \n    Instrument Electronics 'IRTM'\n    =============================\n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The signal channels use a synchronous demodulation scheme to\n        provide good stability and to avoid 1/f noise in the preamp.\n        The input FET chopper is a full-wave type operating at 471\n        Hz.  This and the center-tapped thermopile allow voltage\n        doubling of the detector signal and noise and thus reduce the\n        preamp noise contribution which otherwise would be\n        significant.  The differential input connection, while\n        suffering a square root (2) noise disadvantage compared to\n        single-ended input, provides excellent common mode rejection\n        of chopper spikes and other input noise.  Temperature\n        dependence of the thermopile, about -0.5%/degree C., is\n        compensated by a thermister network external to the hybrid\n        package.  Preamp gain is adjustable with an external\n        resistor.  Following the half-wave synchronous demodulator is\n        an integrate, hold, and reset circuit with an integrate time\n        of 981 msec.  The integrator serves as a low pass filter\n        while the hold feature ensures spatial simultaneity of\n        corresponding detectors in each telescope.  After completion\n        of sampling by the multiplexer, all channel hold circuits are\n        reset to ensure independence of data samples.  The IRTM\n        analog signals, which have a range of +/- 6V, are digitized\n        by the analog-to-pulse width converter and flight data\n        subsystem (FDS) counter into +/- 2**9 levels, yielding 1023\n        data numbers (DN) which are nearly linear with radiance in\n        each channel.  The IRTM multiplexer consists of sixty-eight\n        FET switches and a buffer signal amplifier.  In addition to\n        thirty-two data channels (twenty-eight active and four\n        spare), thirty-two channels of engineering data are also\n        sample.  These include eight temperature measurements from\n        thermisters located at four locations on the reference plate,\n        the electronics module, and each of the three ir detector\n        packages (telescopes A, B, C).  Three power supply voltages\n        and the pre-dc restore voltage of twenty-one channels\n        (telescopes A, B, and C) are monitored.  The pre-dc restore\n        monitors are diagnostic to determine the presence of large\n        thermal or detector offsets.  The scan mirror is driven by a\n        four-position stepper motor through a 50/1 gear reduction.  A\n        motor drive pulse duration of 40 msec allows a 90 degree\n        mirror rotation in 2 sec.  The mirror position is sensed by a\n        two-bit encoder on the motor shaft; the contacts at the three\n        desired positions are about half of the width of 1.8 degree\n        mirror step.  The motor stepping is controlled by the FDS\n        using a comparison of the encoder readout with the desired\n        position originating either from the FDS normal mode clock or\n        direct ground command; the motor cannot be directly\n        commanded.  In addition to the restore which occurs\n        automatically in the normal model when the mirror reaches the\n        space position, restores can be ground commanded when the\n        IRTM is in the fixed planet or fixed space mode; in either\n        case housekeeping data are multiplexed into the data stream\n        during the 1-sec restore period.  Whenever the mirror reaches\n        the reference position, the calibration lamp is turned on for\n        the next two integration periods.  The lamp is at full\n        radiance throughout the second integration period, which is\n        used for gain determination of the D telescope channels.  In\n        the fixed reference mode, science and housekeeping data are\n        sampled alternatively.\n \n \n    Instrument Filter 'A - T20'\n    ===========================\n      Filter Name                    : T20\n      Filter Type                    : RESTSTRAHLEN\n      Minimum Wavelength             : 17.700000\n      Maximum Wavelength             : 30.000000\n      Center Filter Wavelength       : 21.000000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        Relative spectral response of all channels was measured end\n        to end using a Perkin-Elmer 16 U monochrometer with\n        appropriate gratings and order filters.  A globar at 1400 K\n        was used in the 2-25 micrometer range; shortward of 2.0\n        micrometers a tungsten source at 2700 K was used.  The\n        reference detector was a thermocouple for all but the 0.4-1.1\n        micrometer range, where a calibrated silicon photodiode was\n        used.  Out-of-band measurements were made by replacing the\n        spectrometer grating with a plane mirror and ir materials\n        having known cutoff and cuton wavelengths.  Flux calibration\n        of the IRTM was performed under a simulated space environment\n        using a vacuum chamber operated typically at a pressure of\n        1.E-6 Torr.  The IRTM was operated by means of a console\n        which simulated the interfaces and functions of the\n        spacecraft FDS.  A minicomputer was used to provide all\n        operational sequences and modes.  Data were recorded on\n        magnetic tape for subsequent computer processing.  The\n        calibration fixture consisted of two identical blackbodies,\n        one located in front of the space port and maintained at\n        liquid nitrogen temperature and the other in front of the\n        plant port and adjustable in temperature from 77 K to 350K;\n        eleven settings from 140 K to 330 K were used.  Blackbody\n        temperatures were measured with platinum resistance\n        thermometers having an absolute accuracy of +/- 0.1 degrees\n        C.  traceable to the National Bureau of Standards.  The\n        digitizer used in the test console provided ten times the\n        resolution of the FDS digitizer, thus making the digitizing\n        uncertainty during calibration insignificant compared to the\n        noise.  The calibration data thus produced are IRTM output in\n        digitization level (DN) as a function of blackbody\n        temperature.  Radiometrically measured internal reference\n        surface temperatures showed close agreement (+/- 0.5 degrees\n        C.) with those measured independently with a thermister.  The\n        IRTM temperature was controlled by regulating the temperature\n        of a mounting base plate and the thermal shield inside the\n        vacuum chamber.  Calibration was performed at 10 degrees C.\n        spacing across the range of operating temperatures expected\n        during flight.  Typical IRTM channel response to scene\n        brightness temperatures is shown in Fig.  8 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The one-sample noise on the thermal\n        channels is less than 1 DN except for the 15 micrometer\n        channel where it is about 2.5 DN.

The\n        digitizer used in the test console provided ten times the\n        resolution of the FDS digitizer, thus making the digitizing\n        uncertainty during calibration insignificant compared to the\n        noise.  The calibration data thus produced are IRTM output in\n        digitization level (DN) as a function of blackbody\n        temperature.

It is an f/3.5, 20.3-cm focal\n        length Cassegrainian design with an aperture diameter of\n        5.8-cm., spherical surfaces, and, except for mirror\n        materials, is identical to the B and C telescopes.  By using\n        relatively slow fore optics, degradation of filter sharpness\n        normally caused by operating an interference filter in a low\n        f-number beam is negligible.  The focal plane contains a\n        field-defining aperture plate with seven 0.107-cm diameter\n        holes arranged in a chevron pattern.  The fields of view thus\n        defined are nested with those of the MAWD and imaging systems\n        (Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978).  Behind each hole in the field\n        stop plate is a lens which produces a 0.0254-cm diam image of\n        the telescope aperture on the detector, which itself is about\n        the same size.  The final optical speed at the detector is\n        f/1.  Optical materials used in the four telescopes are shown\n        in Table II, and the resulting spectral response is shown in\n        Fig.  5 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  Mirrors are made of hot-pressed\n        uncoated zinc oxide for both primary and secondary mirrors.\n        The reststrahlen reflection properties of ZnO are the major\n        factors in the A telescope spectral response.  Minimizing\n        extrafield sensitivity (EFS) was an important aspect of the\n        optical design since on previous Mariner radiometers EFS\n        contribution seriously compromised observations of scenes\n        near large temperature contrasts (points near the planetary\n        limb and polar caps).  During instrumentation development,\n        IRTM image quality was determined in two angular regions.  In\n        the near-field region, a laboratory collimator and ir source\n        were used to measure the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad\n        diam (three fields of view).  Point source field of view\n        measurements in this region are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far field measurements, sensitivity\n        constraints dictated an approach in which the fraction of\n        energy within a given angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm\n        diam, concentric grooved, blackbody plate with a series of\n        restricting apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm,\n        140-cm, and 610-cm) to define angular response regions from\n        about one field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the\n        telescope focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at\n        that distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2\n        mrad).  The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a\n        heater/regulator and integral water jacket.  To prevent\n        difficulties with atmospheric transmission, the entire\n        apparatus was contained in a polyethylene bag flushed with\n        dry N2.  The EFS problem was more severe for the longer\n        wavelength A telescope than the others, possibly owing to the\n        higher reflectance at longer wavelengths of the black paint\n        used inside the telescope.  Tests using this apparatus led to\n        several telescope modifications designed to reduce EFS (see\n        Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal baffle was\n        placed between the field lens and the detectors to confine\n        energy to the sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A spider\n        baffle, added to the outer edges of the secondary mirror\n        support spider, was designed to reduce reflection off the\n        sides of the spider legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with CTL\n        15 black paint was placed on the central dead spot of the\n        secondary mirror.  This was designed to prevent focal plane\n        reflections from falling on the detectors.  Of these three\n        modifications, only the cone baffle gave significant\n        improvement, although all three were incorporated in the\n        design.  These results of the final EFS measurements are\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response\n        due to diffraction and the measured values are shown.  The\n        integrated EFS response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was\n        about 4%.  Of this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.\n        The effect of response outside of the nominal field of view\n        can be estimated directly from data obtained on scans across\n        the hot (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the\n        response is circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates\n        this to be closely followed, the signature of a half space\n        would also be symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived\n        from a Viking 1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was\n        determined using a 20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate\n        all four telescopes with a small source of high temperature\n        blackbody radiation.  Measurements were taken simultaneously\n        in twenty-eight channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.\n        For each channel, a parabolic ellipsoid was fit to data where\n        the measured intensity was more than 10% of the peak\n        intensity in that channel.  The alignment of each telescope\n        was ascertained by combining the center of response so\n        determined for the seven channels in the telescope.  This\n        procedure allowed for the alignment of the four telescopes to\n        be determined with an estimated precision of 0.1 mrad.  The\n        back of the secondary mirror of the B telescope was\n        aluminized and used as the alignment reference for this\n        procedure and for instrument alignment on the spacecraft.\n        The instrument pointing direction was verified in the same\n        manner just prior to planetary encounter using Mars as a\n        5-mrad diam source and using the science platform motion to\n        generate a 5-mrad spaced grid.  The in-flight alignment is\n        shown in Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n \n \n    Instrument Optics 'B'\n    =====================\n      Telescope Diameter             : 0.058000\n      Telescope F Number             : 3.500000\n      Telescope Focal Length         : 0.203000\n      Telescope Resolution           : 0.005100\n      Telescope T Number             : UNK\n      Telescope Transmittance        : UNK\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The A telescope (17.7-24 micrometer) is shown schematically\n        in Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.

The\n        out-of-band response for the B telescope is less than 0.1% of\n        full scale for an object of 1.E-6 the radiance of a 5800-K\n        blackbody, the level expected for reflectance from the\n        subsolar region of Mars.  Minimizing extrafield sensitivity\n        (EFS) was an important aspect of the optical design since on\n        previous Mariner radiometers EFS contribution seriously\n        compromised observations of scenes near large temperature\n        contrasts (points near the planetary limb and polar caps).\n        During instrumentation development, IRTM image quality was\n        determined in two angular regions.  In the near-field region,\n        a laboratory collimator and ir source were used to measure\n        the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad diam (three fields of\n        view).  Point source field of view measurements in this\n        region are shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far\n        field measurements, sensitivity constraints dictated an\n        approach in which the fraction of energy within a given\n        angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm diam, concentric\n        grooved, blackbody plate with a series of restricting\n        apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm, 140-cm, and\n        610-cm) to define angular response regions from about one\n        field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the telescope\n        focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at that\n        distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2 mrad).\n        The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a heater/regulator\n        and integral water jacket.  To prevent difficulties with\n        atmospheric transmission, the entire apparatus was contained\n        in a polyethylene bag flushed with dry N2.  Tests using this\n        apparatus led to several telescope modifications designed to\n        reduce EFS (see Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal\n        baffle was placed between the field lens and the detectors to\n        confine energy to the sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A\n        spider baffle, added to the outer edges of the secondary\n        mirror support spider, was designed to reduce reflection off\n        the sides of the spider legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with\n        CTL 15 black paint was placed on the central dead spot of the\n        secondary mirror.  This was designed to prevent focal plane\n        reflections from falling on the detectors.  Of these three\n        modifications, only the cone baffle gave significant\n        improvement, although all three were incorporated in the\n        design.  These results of the final EFS measurements are\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response\n        due to diffraction and the measured values are shown.  The\n        integrated EFS response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was\n        about 4%.  Of this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.\n        The effect of response outside of the nominal field of view\n        can be estimated directly from data obtained on scans across\n        the hot (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the\n        response is circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates\n        this to be closely followed, the signature of a half space\n        would also be symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived\n        from a Viking 1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was\n        determined using a 20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate\n        all four telescopes with a small source of high temperature\n        blackbody radiation.  Measurements were taken simultaneously\n        in twenty-eight channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.\n        For each channel, a parabolic ellipsoid was fit to data where\n        the measured intensity was more than 10% of the peak\n        intensity in that channel.  The alignment of each telescope\n        was ascertained by combining the center of response so\n        determined for the seven channels in the telescope.  This\n        procedure allowed by the alignment of the four telescopes to\n        be determined with an estimated precision of 0.1 mrad.  The\n        back of the secondary mirror of the B telescope was\n        aluminized and used as the alignment reference for this\n        procedure and for instrument alignment on the spacecraft.\n        The instrument pointing direction was verified in the same\n        manner just prior to planetary encounter using Mars as a\n        5-mrad diam source and using the science platform motion to\n        generate a 5-mrad spaced grid.  The in-flight alignment is\n        shown in Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n \n \n    Instrument Optics 'C'\n    =====================\n      Telescope Diameter             : 0.058000\n      Telescope F Number             : 3.500000\n      Telescope Focal Length         : 0.203000\n      Telescope Resolution           : 0.005100\n      Telescope T Number             : UNK\n      Telescope Transmittance        : UNK\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The A telescope (17.7-24 micrometer) is shown schematically\n        in Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  It is an f/3.5, 20.3-cm focal\n        length Cassegrainian design with an aperture diameter of\n        5.8-cm., spherical surfaces, and, except for mirror\n        materials, is identical to the B and C telescopes.  The focal\n        plane contains a field-defining aperture plate with seven\n        0.107-cm diameter holes arranged in a chevron pattern.  The\n        fields of view thus defined are nested with those of the MAWD\n        and imaging systems (Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978).  Behind\n        each hole in the field stop plate is a lens which produces a\n        0.0254-cm diam image of the telescope aperture on the\n        detector, which itself is about the same size.  The final\n        optical speed at the detector is f/1.  Optical materials used\n        in the four telescopes are shown in Table II, and the\n        resulting spectral response is shown in Fig.  5 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  Mirrors are made of aluminized and SiO\n        overcoated fused silica except for the A telescope, which\n        uses hot-pressed uncoated zinc oxide for both primary and\n        secondary mirrors.  The spectral bandpass of the other ir\n        channels is determined by interference bandpass filters and\n        AR coated detector lenses.  The out-of-band response for the\n        B and C telescopes is less than 0.1% of full scale for an\n        object of 1.E-6 the radiance of a 5800-K blackbody, the level\n        expected for reflectance from the subsolar region of Mars.\n        The A band has less than 0.1% response for wavelengths less\n        than 16 micrometer, and wavelengths longer than 30 micrometer\n        are limited by the Irtran 6 field lens.  Minimizing\n        extrafield sensitivity (EFS) was an important aspect of the\n        optical design since on previous Mariner radiometers EFS\n        contribution seriously compromised observations of scenes\n        near large temperature contrasts (points near the planetary\n        limb and polar caps).  During instrumentation development,\n        IRTM image quality was determined in two angular regions.  In\n        the near-field region, a laboratory collimator and ir source\n        were used to measure the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad\n        diam (three fields of view).  Point source field of view\n        measurements in this region are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far field measurements, sensitivity\n        constraints dictated an approach in which the fraction of\n        energy within a given angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm\n        diam, concentric grooved, blackbody plate with a series of\n        restricting apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm,\n        140-cm, and 610-cm) to define angular response regions from\n        about one field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the\n        telescope focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at\n        that distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2\n        mrad).  The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a\n        heater/regulator and integral water jacket.  To prevent\n        difficulties with atmospheric transmission, the entire\n        apparatus was contained in a polyethylene bag flushed with\n        dry N2.  Tests using this apparatus led to several telescope\n        modifications designed to reduce EFS (see Fig.  3 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal baffle was placed between\n        the field lens and the detectors to confine energy to the\n        sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A spider baffle, added\n        to the outer edges of the secondary mirror support spider,\n        was designed to reduce reflection off the sides of the spider\n        legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with CTL 15 black paint was\n        placed on the central dead spot of the secondary mirror.\n        This was designed to prevent focal plane reflections from\n        falling on the detectors.  Of these three modifications, only\n        the cone baffle gave significant improvement, although all\n        three were incorporated in the design.  These results of the\n        final EFS measurements are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response due to diffraction\n        and the measured values are shown.  The integrated EFS\n        response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was about 4%.  Of\n        this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.  The effect of\n        response outside of the nominal field of view can be\n        estimated directly from data obtained on scans across the hot\n        (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the response is\n        circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates this to be\n        closely followed, the signature of a half space would also be\n        symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived from a Viking\n        1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is shown in Fig.\n        6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was determined using a\n        20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate all four telescopes\n        with a small source of high temperature blackbody radiation.\n        Measurements were taken simultaneously in twenty-eight\n        channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.

The back\n        of the secondary mirror of the B telescope was aluminized and\n        used as the alignment reference for this procedure and for\n        instrument alignment on the spacecraft.  The instrument\n        pointing direction was verified in the same manner just prior\n        to planetary encounter using Mars as a 5-mrad diam source and\n        using the science platform motion to generate a 5-mrad spaced\n        grid.  The in-flight alignment is shown in Fig.  4 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n \n \n    Instrument Optics 'D'\n    =====================\n      Telescope Diameter             : 0.037000\n      Telescope F Number             : 5.500000\n      Telescope Focal Length         : 0.203000\n      Telescope Resolution           : UNK\n      Telescope T Number             : UNK\n      Telescope Transmittance        : UNK\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The D telescope has a reduced aperture of 3.7 cm and a focal\n        length of f/5.5.  By using relatively slow fore optics,\n        degradation of filter sharpness normally caused by operating\n        an interference filter in a low f-number beam is negligible.\n        The focal plane contains a field-defining aperture plate with\n        seven 0.107-cm diam holes arranged in a chevron pattern.  The\n        fields of view thus defined are nested with those of the MAWD\n        and imaging systems (Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978).  Behind\n        each hole in the field stop plate is a lens which produces a\n        0.0254-cm diam image of the telescope aperture on the\n        detector, which itself is about the same size.  The final\n        optical speed at the detector is f/1.  Optical materials used\n        in the four telescopes are shown in Table II, and the\n        resulting spectral response is shown in Fig.  5 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  Mirrors are made of aluminized and SiO\n        overcoated fused silica except for the A telescope, which\n        uses hot-pressed uncoated zinc oxide for both primary and\n        secondary mirrors.  The spectral bandpass of the other ir\n        channels is determined by interference bandpass filters and\n        AR coated detector lenses.  The transmission elements of the\n        D telescope insure that it is thermally blind.  Special\n        coatings on the D telescope mirrors were used to obtain a\n        reasonably gray response to solar radiation.  Minimizing\n        extrafield sensitivity (EFS) was an important aspect of the\n        optical design since on previous Mariner radiometers EFS\n        contribution seriously compromised observations of scenes\n        near large temperature contrasts (points near the planetary\n        limb and polar caps).  During instrumentation development,\n        IRTM image quality was determined in two angular regions.  In\n        the near-field region, a laboratory collimator and ir source\n        were used to measure the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad\n        diam (three fields of view).  Point source field of view\n        measurements in this region are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far field measurements, sensitivity\n        constraints dictated an approach in which the fraction of\n        energy within a given angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm\n        diam, concentric grooved, blackbody plate with a series of\n        restricting apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm,\n        140-cm, and 610-cm) to define angular response regions from\n        about one field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the\n        telescope focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at\n        that distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2\n        mrad).  The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a\n        heater/regulator and integral water jacket.  To prevent\n        difficulties with atmospheric transmission, the entire\n        apparatus was contained in a polyethylene bag flushed with\n        dry N2.  The EFS problem was more severe for the longer\n        wavelength A telescope than the others, possibly owing to the\n        higher reflectance at longer wavelengths of the black paint\n        used inside the telescope.  Tests using this apparatus led to\n        several telescope modifications designed to reduce EFS (see\n        Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal baffle was\n        placed between the field lens and the detectors to confine\n        energy to the sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A spider\n        baffle, added to the outer edges of the secondary mirror\n        support spider, was designed to reduce reflection off the\n        sides of the spider legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with CTL\n        15 black paint was placed on the central dead spot of the\n        secondary mirror.  This was designed to prevent focal plane\n        reflections from falling on the detectors.  Of these three\n        modifications, only the cone baffle gave significant\n        improvement, although all three were incorporated in the\n        design.  These results of the final EFS measurements are\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response\n        due to diffraction and the measured values are shown.  The\n        integrated EFS response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was\n        about 4%.  Of this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.\n        The effect of response outside of the nominal field of view\n        can be estimated directly from data obtained on scans across\n        the hot (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the\n        response is circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates\n        this to be closely followed, the signature of a half space\n        would also be symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived\n        from a Viking 1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was\n        determined using a 20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate\n        all four telescopes with a small source of high temperature\n        blackbody radiation.  Measurements were taken simultaneously\n        in twenty-eight channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.\n        For each channel, a parabolic ellipsoid was fit to data where\n        the measured intensity was more than 10% of the peak\n        intensity in that channel.

This\n        procedure allowed by the alignment of the four telescopes to\n        be determined with an estimated precision of 0.1 mrad.  The\n        instrument pointing direction was verified in the same manner\n        just prior to planetary encounter using Mars as a 5-mrad diam\n        source and using the science platform motion to generate a\n        5-mrad spaced grid.

The REFERENCE position was\n        also the 'safe' position, used when the instrument was turned\n        off.\n \n        A MODIFIED normal mode was also available, in which the only\n        space view was the first of the cycle, followed by 243 ICKs\n        of planet data.  In NORMAL mode, ICKs 1 and 2 were\n        housekeeping data while the mirror moved to space.  ICK 3 was\n        the space level before reset.  During ICK 4, the electronics\n        for all channels were reset so that the sensed radiance\n        (meant to be the cosmic background level of essentially zero\n        radiance) yielded a data number (DN) of a few.  There was a\n        filter on the reset so that the voltage change was only about\n        2/3 of the way to the space radiance level; this smoothed out\n        the zero setting, but also meant that several cycles were\n        required to recover from a serious drift.  ICK 5 was still in\n        the space position and yielded the DN response to space.  Ick\n        6 and 7 were housekeeping data while the mirror moved to the\n        reference position.  ICK 8 and 9 were the DN response to the\n        reference surface; only the second reading was used in\n        calibration of the solar channel to allow the lamp filament\n        to warm up completely.  ICKs 10 through 13 were housekeeping\n        data while the mirror moved to the planet position.  The 57\n        ICKs 14-64 were planet data.  The 7 ICK cycle to space, with\n        reset of the zero-radiance DN level in all channels, was\n        repeated each 64 ICKs, beginning on ICKs 65, 129, and 193,\n        with motion directly back to the planet position for another\n        57 ICKs of planet data.\n \n \n    Instrument Mode 'NORMAL'\n    ========================\n      Instrument Power Consumption : 6.000000\n \n \n      In sections\n      -----------\n        IRTM\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        Other than power on or power off, the only command options\n        for the IRTM controlled the motion of the scan mirror.  This\n        mirror could be commanded to 3 positions, separated by 90\n        degrees; PLANET, SPACE, and REFERENCE.  In the PLANET\n        position, data were acquired in all 28 channels.  In SPACE,\n        the zero-radiance level was reset to near the bottom of the\n        dynamic range.  In the REFERENCE position, gain calibration\n        data was obtained using both a grooved blackbody at ambient\n        instrument temperature and a small lamp and hemispherical\n        diffuser for the solar telescope.  The REFERENCE position was\n        also the 'safe' position, used when the instrument was turned\n        off.\n \n        The NORMAL mode sequenced the pointing to PLANET most of the\n        time, with pointing to SPACE at intervals of 64 ICKs, and to\n        REFERENCE at intervals of 256 ICKs.  ICK is a one syllable\n        acronym for 'incremental counter keeper' and represents 1.12\n        second duration, the basic time interval of IRTM operation.\n        It required 2 ICKs for the mirror to move 90 degrees and\n        settle; whenever the mirror was in motion the downlink data\n        contained housekeeping information about instrument status\n        and detector voltage levels.  In NORMAL mode, ICKs 1 and 2\n        were housekeeping data while the mirror moved to space.  ICK\n        3 was the space level before reset.  During ICK 4, the\n        electronics for all channels were reset so that the sensed\n        radiance (meant to be the cosmic background level of\n        essentially zero radiance) yielded a data number (DN) of a\n        few.  There was a filter on the reset so that the voltage\n        change was only about 2/3 of the way to the space radiance\n        level; this smoothed out the zero setting, but also meant\n        that several cycles were required to recover from a serious\n        drift.  ICK 5 was still in the space position and yielded the\n        DN response to space.  Ick 6 and 7 were housekeeping data\n        while the mirror moved to the reference position.  ICK 8 and\n        9 were the DN response to the reference surface; only the\n        second reading was used in calibration of the solar channel\n        to allow the lamp filament to warm up completely.  ICKs 10\n        through 13 were housekeeping data while the mirror moved to\n        the planet position.  The 57 ICKs 14-64 were planet data.\n        The 7 ICK cycle to space, with reset of the zero-radiance DN\n        level in all channels, was repeated each 64 ICKs, beginning\n        on ICKs 65, 129, and 193, with motion directly back to the\n        planet position for another 57 ICKs of planet data.\n \n \n    Mounted On Platform 'SCAN PLATFORM'\n    ===================================\n      Cone Offset Angle              : 0.070000\n      Cross Cone Offset Angle        : 0.030000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        OFFSET ANGLE SCALED FROM FIGURE 4 OF CHASE_ETAL_1978; these\n        were determined by scans across Mars during approach, when\n        the angular diameter of the planet was 1.93 and 4.79\n        milliradians (VO-1)","is_prime":true,"tools":[]},{"tags":["Spectrometer"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mawd.vo2","display_name":"Viking Orbiter 2 Mars Atmospheric Water Detector","display_description":"INSTRUMENT: MARS ATMOSPHERIC WATER DETECTOR\n        SPACECRAFT: VIKING ORBITER 2\n \n \n    Instrument Information\n    ======================\n      Instrument Id                  : MAWD\n      Instrument Host Id             : VO2\n      Pi Pds User Id                 : CBFARMER\n      Instrument Name                : MARS ATMOSPHERIC WATER\n                                         DETECTOR\n      Instrument Type                : UNK\n      Build Date                     : UNK\n      Instrument Mass                : UNK\n      Instrument Length              : UNK\n      Instrument Width               : UNK\n      Instrument Height              : UNK\n      Instrument Serial Number       : UNK\n      Instrument Manufacturer Name   : JET PROPULSION LABORATORY\n \n \n    Instrument Description\n    ======================\n      This experiment was designed to measure the absorption of solar\n      radiation by the strong lines at the center of the 1.4\n      micrometer (7200 cm**-1) combination vibration-rotation bands\n      of water vapor.  The MAWD instrument is a fixed grating\n      spectrometer having five channels centered on three absorption\n      lines and two continuum regions between these lines.  All\n      channels utilize PbS detectors; the spectral resolution of each\n      is about 1.2 cm**-1.  The instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of\n      the detectors is 0.96 by 0.12 degree.  The IFOV can be\n      step-scanned perpendicular to its long dimension through\n      fifteen positions by a raster mirror incorporated in the\n      optical train.  The time spent at each step (approximately the\n      signal integration time) is 280 milliseconds, and the duration\n      of the raster is 4.48 seconds.  The combination of the motions\n      of the raster mirror, the orbiter scan platform, and the\n      orbital ground track generates sets of slew patterns over the\n      planet's surface.  A basic description of the instrument, its\n      observational modes and its derived data products is given in\n      FARMER_ETAL_1977.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      There are two major objectives of the Viking MAWD experiments.\n      The first of these is to map, during the far encounter and\n      preliminary orbital phases, the distribution of water vapor\n      over the planet, and in this way perform the vital initial\n      function of investigating prospective lading sites with respect\n      to this particular characteristic.  The second objective is\n      concerned with the nature of the water vapor cycle itself and\n      the relationship between the martian atmospheric and surface or\n      subsurface water.  To this end, the observations are designed\n      to investigate spatial, diurnal, and seasonal variations of\n      water vapor with high spatial and temporal resolutions.  A\n      basic description of the instrument, its observational modes\n      and its derived data products is given in FARMER_ETAL_1977.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Viking Orbiter 2 did not jettison its bioshield as planned,\n      making it impossible for MAWD to view the calibration plate.\n      Thus, no inflight calibrations were possible for the VO2 MAWD.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The precise frequency location of the various channels is\n      maintained against possible shifts due to thermal distortion of\n      the instrument's optical alignment by a monochromatic neon\n      reference system, using a set of silicon photodiodes as\n      detectors.  Motion of the neon lamp exit plane image with\n      respect to the silicon reference detectors is sensed and used\n      to drive a cam which repositions the grating to preserve the\n      correct wavelength alignment.  The channel responses are\n      corrected by means of periodic calibrations made by inserting a\n      mirror into the input beam so that the detectors view a\n      sunlight-illuminated diffusely reflecting plate mounted on a\n      structural member of the spacecraft.\n \n \n    Section 'MAWD'\n    ==============\n      Total Fovs                     : 15\n      Data Rate

The camera system is commonly called the Visual\n      Imaging Subsystem (VIS).  Each camera consists of a telescope,\n      a slow scan vidicon, a filter wheel, and associated\n      electronics.  The filter wheel contains blue, minus blue,\n      violet, clear, green, and red filters.  The angular field of\n      view as defined by the reseau pattern is 1.51 by 1.69 degrees.\n      Since the scan lines go beyond the reseau pattern in the line\n      direction the active field of view is about 1.54 degrees in\n      this direction.  The actual ground area covered by an image\n      varies as a function of spacecraft altitude and emission angle.\n      The digital image is generated by scanning the vidicon face\n      plate.  The signal is digitized as a 7-bit number.  The image\n      contains 1056 horizontal lines.  There are 1182 samples in each\n      line exposed to incoming light.  The vidicon samples 11 pixels\n      on either side of the raster onto an opaque mask located at the\n      front of each vidicon.  Hence, 1204 samples per line are\n      telemetered to Earth, but only 1182 contain information.  Each\n      camera can be commanded to acquire an image every 8.96 seconds.\n      By alternating cameras, an image can be taken every 4.48\n      seconds.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The first objective of the imaging system was to characterize\n      potential landing sites in support of site selection.\n      Additional objectives of the imaging system were to study the\n      photometric and colorimetric properties of the surface\n      discovered by Mariner 9 in order to better understand the\n      geological history of Mars atmosphere.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Each Viking Orbiter camera contained a filter wheel with five\n      filters and a clear position, i.e., no filter.  An image could\n      be acquired using one of the six filters types, which included\n      blue, minus blue, violet, clear, green, and red.  The filter\n      wheel could be stepped only one position between each exposure.\n      Three mode parameters or camera states could be set for a given\n      exposure.  There was the light flood condition flag.  Light\n      flooding was used to reduce the residual image from the\n      previous exposure.  Eight small incandescent bulbs exposed the\n      vidicon beyond saturation.  There were also two gain states:\n      low and high.  The high gain state increased the gain by a\n      factor of 2.  There was also an exposure offset that would\n      provide a positive signal (DN) from the camera even for a zero\n      exposure.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal\n      received from the camera (DN value) into a quantity that is\n      proportional to the radiance reaching the sensor.  The\n      sensitivity of the vidicon varies across the field of view.\n      The sensitivity of the vidicon also varies with time.  Each\n      Viking Orbiter imaging instrument was calibrated before flight.\n      In addition, changes in the calibration over time have been\n      estimated from analyses of images of deep space and dust\n      storms.  The radiometric calibration applies additive and\n      multiplicative corrections that account for the varying\n      sensitivity of the vidicon.  The resulting values are\n      proportional to radiance factor, which is defined as the ratio\n      of the observed radiance to the radiance of a normally\n      illuminated lambertian reflector of unit reflectance at the\n      same heliocentric distance.  The geometric calibration removes\n      electronic distortions and transforms the point perspective\n      geometry of the original image into a map projection.  The\n      electronic distortions are barrel- shaped distortions from the\n      electron beam readout and complex distortions from interactions\n      between the charge on the vidicon face plate and the electron\n      beam.  The electronic distortions are modeled by comparing the\n      undistorted locations of reseau marks with the actual locations\n      in an image.\n \n \n    Section 'VISA'\n    ==============\n      Total Fovs                     : 1\n      Data Rate                      : 2112000.000000\n      Sample Bits                    : 7\n \n \n      'VISA' Detectors\n      ----------------\n        VISA\n \n \n      'VISA' Electronics\n      ------------------\n        VISA\n \n \n      'VISA' Filters\n      --------------\n        BLUE\n        CLEAR\n        GREEN\n        MINUS BLUE\n        RED\n        VIOLET\n \n \n      'VISA' Section Optic IDs\n      ------------------------\n        VISA\n \n \n      In modes\n      --------\n        ...\n        ..D\n        .G.\n        .GD\n        L..\n        L.D\n        LG.\n        LGD\n \n \n      'VISA' Section FOV Shape 'RECTANGULAR'\n      --------------------------------------\n        Section Id                     : VISA\n        Fovs                           : 1\n        Horizontal Pixel Fov           : 0.001420\n        Vertical Pixel Fov             : 0.001420\n        Horizontal Fov                 : 1.692000\n        Vertical Fov                   : 1.543000\n \n \n      'VISA' Section Parameter 'RADIANCE'\n      -----------------------------------\n        Radiance is the amount of energy per time per projected area\n        per steradian.\n \n        Instrument Parameter Name      : RADIANCE\n        Sampling Parameter Name        : PIXEL\n        Instrument Parameter Unit      : WATT/(METER*METER)/STERADIAN\n        Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 0.001420\n        Sampling Parameter Unit        : DEGREE\n \n \n    Instrument Detector 'VISA'\n    ==========================\n      Detector Type                  : VIDICON\n      Detector Aspect Ratio          : 1.120000\n      Minimum Wavelength             : 0.350000\n      Maximum Wavelength             : 0.650000\n      Nominal Operating Temperature  : 288.000000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The VIS detector is a Westinghouse 5166 selenium vidicon.

The camera system is commonly called the Visual\n      Imaging Subsystem (VIS).  Each camera consists of a telescope,\n      a slow scan vidicon, a filter wheel, and associated\n      electronics.  The filter wheel contains blue, minus blue,\n      violet, clear, green, and red filters.  The angular field of\n      view as defined by the reseau pattern is 1.51 by 1.69 degrees.\n      Since the scan lines go beyond the reseau pattern in the line\n      direction the active field of view is about 1.54 degrees in\n      this direction.  The actual ground area covered by an image\n      varies as a function of spacecraft altitude and emission angle.\n      The digital image is generated by scanning the vidicon face\n      plate.  The signal is digitized as a 7-bit number.  The image\n      contains 1056 horizontal lines.  There are 1182 samples in each\n      line exposed to incoming light.  The vidicon samples 11 pixels\n      on either side of the raster onto an opaque mask located at the\n      front of each vidicon.  Hence, 1204 samples per line are\n      telemetered to Earth, but only 1182 contain information.  Each\n      camera can be commanded to acquire an image every 8.96 seconds.\n      By alternating cameras, an image can be taken every 4.48\n      seconds.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The first objective of the imaging system was to characterize\n      potential landing sites in support of site selection.\n      Additional objectives of the imaging system were to study the\n      photometric and colorimetric properties of the surface\n      discovered by Mariner 9 in order to better understand the\n      geological history of Mars atmosphere.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Each Viking Orbiter camera contained a filter wheel with five\n      filters and a clear position, i.e., no filter.  An image could\n      be acquired using one of the six filters types, which included\n      blue, minus blue, violet, clear, green, and red.  The filter\n      wheel could be stepped only one position between each exposure.\n      Three mode parameters or camera states could be set for a given\n      exposure.  There was the light flood condition flag.  Light\n      flooding was used to reduce the residual image from the\n      previous exposure.  Eight small incandescent bulbs exposed the\n      vidicon beyond saturation.  There were also two gain states:\n      low and high.  The high gain state increased the gain by a\n      factor of 2.  There was also an exposure offset that would\n      provide a positive signal (DN) from the camera even for a zero\n      exposure.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal\n      received from the camera (DN value) into a quantity that is\n      proportional to the radiance reaching the sensor.  The\n      sensitivity of the vidicon varies across the field of view.\n      The sensitivity of the vidicon also varies with time.  Each\n      Viking Orbiter imaging instrument was calibrated before flight.\n      In addition, changes in the calibration over time have been\n      estimated from analyses of images of deep space and dust\n      storms.  The radiometric calibration applies additive and\n      multiplicative corrections that account for the varying\n      sensitivity of the vidicon.  The resulting values are\n      proportional to radiance factor, which is defined as the ratio\n      of the observed radiance to the radiance of a normally\n      illuminated lambertian reflector of unit reflectance at the\n      same heliocentric distance.  The geometric calibration removes\n      electronic distortions and transforms the point perspective\n      geometry of the original image into a map projection.  The\n      electronic distortions are barrel- shaped distortions from the\n      electron beam readout and complex distortions from interactions\n      between the charge on the vidicon face plate and the electron\n      beam.  The electronic distortions are modeled by comparing the\n      undistorted locations of reseau marks with the actual locations\n      in an image.\n \n \n    Section 'VISB'\n    ==============\n      Total Fovs                     : 1\n      Data Rate                      : 2112000.000000\n      Sample Bits                    : 7\n \n \n      'VISB' Detectors\n      ----------------\n        VISB\n \n \n      'VISB' Electronics\n      ------------------\n        VISB\n \n \n      'VISB' Filters\n      --------------\n        BLUE\n        CLEAR\n        GREEN\n        MINUS BLUE\n        RED\n        VIOLET\n \n \n      'VISB' Section Optic IDs\n      ------------------------\n        VISB\n \n \n      In modes\n      --------\n        ...\n        ..D\n        .G.\n        .GD\n        L..\n        L.D\n        LG.\n        LGD\n \n \n      'VISB' Section FOV Shape 'RECTANGULAR'\n      --------------------------------------\n        Section Id                     : VISB\n        Fovs                           : 1\n        Horizontal Pixel Fov           : 0.001420\n        Vertical Pixel Fov             : 0.001420\n        Horizontal Fov                 : 1.693000\n        Vertical Fov                   : 1.538000\n \n \n      'VISB' Section Parameter 'RADIANCE'\n      -----------------------------------\n        Radiance is the amount of energy per time per projected area\n        per steradian.\n \n        Instrument Parameter Name      : RADIANCE\n        Sampling Parameter Name        : PIXEL\n        Instrument Parameter Unit      : WATT/(METER*METER)/STERADIAN\n        Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 0.001420\n        Sampling Parameter Unit        : DEGREE\n \n \n    Instrument Detector 'VISB'\n    ==========================\n      Detector Type                  : VIDICON\n      Detector Aspect Ratio          : 1.120000\n      Minimum Wavelength             : 0.350000\n      Maximum Wavelength             : 0.650000\n      Nominal Operating Temperature  : 288.000000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The VIS detector is a Westinghouse 5166 selenium vidicon.

There is a total of\n      twenty-eight channels in four surface and one atmospheric\n      thermal band from 6 micrometer to 30 micrometer and a broad\n      solar reflectance band.  All channels are sampled\n      simultaneously, using the spacecraft scanning capability to map\n      the radiance over small and large areas of the planet.  All\n      channels use thermopile detectors; spectral passbands are\n      determined by a combination of interference filters, detector\n      lens materials, antireflection coatings, and reststrahlen\n      optics.  The scan modes are described in the PDS INSTRUMENT\n      MODE DESCRIPTION.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The objective of the Viking Orbiter infrared thermal mapper\n      (IRTM) is to measure the thermal emission of the Martian\n      surface and atmosphere and total reflected sunlight with high\n      spatial and flux resolution.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Most low and moderate resolution IRTM data were acquired\n      through using 'box scans'.  These were commonly acquired\n      between 1-6 hours from periapsis, and utilized the scan\n      platform to slew back and forth in cone angle (in the direction\n      the IRTM chevron points) with small offsets in the same\n      direction between these oscillating slews.  Ignoring spacecraft\n      motion, this pattern would generate bi-directional evenly\n      spaced scans with the seven IRTM detectors.  Spacecraft motion\n      during the scan sequence, typically of 10-40 minutes duration,\n      created some distortion in this otherwise uniform pattern.\n      Typical resulting scans across the planetary surface are shown\n      in Figure 3 of Kieffer et al., 1976.  These scans were usually\n      designed to extend slightly off the limb of the planet on at\n      least one side.  These 'planet port' off-planet data provided\n      the best estimates of the zero radiance response of the\n      instrument.  When the spacecraft was near periapsis, the\n      apparent motion of the planetary surface relative to the\n      spacecraft was too rapid to allow oscillating slews.  At these\n      times, the instrument would simply 'stare' in one direction and\n      use the spacecraft motion to sweep the detector pattern across\n      the surface.  These observations were usually acquired in\n      Normal Mode, but occasionally Fixed Planet was used.  At\n      irregular times through the mission, 'phase function'\n      observations were made.  These involved using the two axis scan\n      platform to follow one point on the ground as the spacecraft\n      went from horizon to horizon relative to this surface point.\n      In actuality, this sequence was acquired using a small number\n      of discrete scan platform moves, allowing the instrument to\n      'stare' across a short stripe centered on the target point\n      between slews.  Such 'phase function' observations typically\n      yielded about 10 different viewing geometries within a single\n      sequence.  These observations were particularly useful in\n      determining the influence of the atmosphere.  In preparation of\n      the IRTM data set, all observations which were more than 1 1/2\n      degrees apparent angle above the nearest limb of the planet\n      were deleted.\n \n      Geometry Errors Due to Uncertain Timing: Early and late during\n      the Viking mission, orbital solutions based on the tracking\n      telemetry were determined every few days.  During VO-1\n      revolution 175-603 and VO-2 revolutions 118-521, orbital\n      solutions were often separated by a week or more.  Because\n      there is significant irregularity in the Martian gravitional\n      field, these irregularities could slowly influence the orbit of\n      the Viking spacecraft in unpredictable ways.  The primary\n      influence was in the period of the orbit, resulting in\n      uncertainty as to exactly where the spacecraft was along its\n      orbit at any specific time.  These uncertainties were as large\n      as 75 seconds in the worst case.  Far from periapsis, these\n      timing uncertainties were not of major significance because the\n      spacecraft velocities were low and the projected fields of\n      views on the planet were large.  However, near periapsis, the\n      IRTM field of view could move across the surface equivalent to\n      its full width in as little as one second.  Thus, when there\n      was a large timing error, the computed ground intercept\n      locations could be in error by many fields of view.  In the\n      worst case, these positions may be in error by up to 200 km.\n      When the magnitude of this problem was discovered, the SEDR\n      (geometry calculations) for the imaging instrument was rerun\n      with revised orbit solutions.  However, it was impractical to\n      regenerate the IRTM SEDR and these errors have not been\n      corrected.  There was an attempt by the navigational team to\n      estimate the magnitude of the timing error for both Viking\n      spacecraft for those revolutions through the affected part of\n      the Viking mission.  This is described in the 1980 April 14\n      memo by Frank Palluconi, which contains estimates of the\n      magnitude of the error for each revolution.  Hugh Kieffer has a\n      copy (the sole surviving copy?) of this memo.  A direct\n      determination of the timing offset can be made from the IRTM\n      data alone in those instances when thermal patterns can be\n      unambiguously identified with surface features.  Since the\n      dominant geometric error is in time, maps of thermal patterns\n      (typically as contours of observed temperature minus the\n      calculated standard model temperature) can be slid across the\n      cartographic map parallel to the subspacecraft track (if the\n      instrument was in fixed planet mode, this is simply sliding the\n      IRTM trace along its own path) until the thermal and\n      cartographic features are aligned.  Because there are small\n      gaps in the IRTM coverage every 64 ICKs, the amount the IRTM\n      pattern must be shifted to agree with the surface morphology\n      can be scaled directly into a timing offset in seconds.  This\n      has been done for a variety of high resolution scans across\n      Arsia Mons (by Jim Zimbelman) and for many scans across Valles\n      Marineris (by David Paige and Hugh Kieffer).  A set of known\n      offsets is slowly accumulating.  Hugh Kieffer has a copy (the\n      sole surviving copy?) of the memo discussing this problem.\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      Relative spectral response of all channels was measured end to\n      end using a Perkin-Elmer 16 U monochrometer with appropriate\n      gratings and order filters.  A globar at 1400 K was used in the\n      2-25 micrometer range; shortward of 2.0 micrometers a tungsten\n      source at 2700 K was used.  The reference detector was a\n      thermocouple for all but the 0.4-1.1 micrometer range, where a\n      calibrated silicon photodiode was used.  Out-of-band\n      measurements were made by replacing the spectrometer grating\n      with a plane mirror and ir materials having known cutoff and\n      cuton wavelengths.  Flux calibration of the IRTM was performed\n      under a simulated space environment using a vacuum chamber\n      operated typically at a pressure of 1.E-6 Torr.  The IRTM was\n      operated by means of a console which simulated the interfaces\n      and functions of the spacecraft FDS.  A minicomputer was used\n      to provide all operational sequences and modes.  Data were\n      recorded on magnetic tape for subsequent computer processing.\n      The calibration fixture consisted of two identical blackbodies,\n      one located in front of the space port and maintained at liquid\n      nitrogen temperature and the other in front of the planet port\n      and adjustable in temperature from 77 K to 350K; eleven\n      settings from 140 K to 330 K were used.  Blackbody temperatures\n      were measured with platinum resistance thermometers having an\n      absolute accuracy of +/- 0.1 degrees C.  traceable to the\n      National Bureau of Standards.  The digitizer used in the test\n      console provided ten times the resolution of the FDS digitizer,\n      thus making the digitizing uncertainty during calibration\n      insignificant compared to the noise.  The calibration data thus\n      produced are IRTM output in digitization level (DN) as a\n      function of blackbody temperature.  Radiometrically measured\n      internal reference surface temperatures showed close agreement\n      (+/- 0.5 degrees C.) with those measured independently with a\n      thermister.  The IRTM temperature was controlled by regulating\n      the temperature of a mounting base plate and the thermal shield\n      inside the vacuum chamber.  Calibration was performed at 10\n      degrees C.  spacing across the range of operating temperatures\n      expected during flight.  Typical IRTM channel response to scene\n      brightness temperatures is shown in Fig.  8 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n      The one-sample noise on the thermal channels is less than 1 DN\n      except for the 15 micrometer channel where it is about 2.5 DN.\n      The dynamic ranges of the surface thermal bands are based on\n      temperatures expected for the Martian surface.  The 300 K\n      maximum chosen for the A telescope might be exceeded by midday\n      summer temperatures, but temperatures above the 310-K limit of\n      the B telescope should not be exceeded unless active volcanic\n      areas were found; temperatures to 320 K and 330 K could be\n      measured by the 9 micrometer and 7 micrometer bands.  The 15\n      micrometer band dynamic range was set quite large as its\n      resolution is noise limited rather than digitization limited.\n      Telescope D channels were calibrated using a different method.\n      The radiance source was a mercury-xenon lamp and narrowband\n      filter centered at 0.896 micrometer with a bandwidth of 425 nm.\n      The in-band radiance of the lamp was known by direct comparison\n      with a standard lamp acquired from the National Bureau of\n      Standards, using a silicon photodiode as a transfer standard.\n      The relative spectral response measurements then allowed\n      extension of the one-point absolute calibration to the entire\n      passband.  Gains for the D channels were set to give full scale\n      for 75% of the diffuse reflection of solar irradiance at Mars\n      average distance from the sun.  Using integrals of the Planck\n      function and the measured spectral response, the flux response\n      of the IRTM is found to be close to linear in the thermal\n      channels.  The best fit quadratic functions, normalized to full\n      scale, typically had constant and quadratic coefficients of\n      0.002 and 0.02, respectively.  The solar band channels, which\n      had much higher absolute flux levels at full scale, showed a\n      decrease in response at high signal levels corresponding to a\n      quadratic coefficient of 0.07.  With the IRTM in the vacuum\n      chamber, the instrument response was measured at four lamp\n      currents.  An additional series of wide band measurements\n      utilizing a NBS standard lamp and a barium sulfate diffusing\n      screen, in which only the lamp-screen distance was changed, was\n      used to determine in detail the solar band nonlinearity.\n      During spacecraft thermal-vacuum testing and in flight, a small\n      drift of about 1-min duration was found to be induced when the\n      scan mirror moved to the reference position in normal mode.\n      This appears to be caused by the decrease in radiative heat\n      loss from the instrument when the telescopes do not view space.\n      The shape of this postreference drift was accurately determined\n      during normal mode sequences when the spacecraft was well away\n      from Mars, and this effect is removed in the data reduction.\n      The change of the thermal state of the IRTM caused by large\n      scan platform slew or planetary radiation near periapsis can\n      introduce significant drifts of the zero-flux level.  These\n      shifts have a time constant of 1-2 min or longer, and their\n      magnitude increases with inband wavelength and preamplifier\n      gain.  It is probably due primarily to very small temperature\n      gradients induced in the detector packages as the general\n      instrument temperature changes.  A significant design feature\n      of the IRTM is that the space DN level of each channel is\n      measured immediately prior to and after the restore which\n      occurs each minute in normal mode.  A linear interpolation\n      between these zero-flux DN levels is used in data\n      decalibration.

The\n        chevron arrangement was based on the need for uniform\n        coverage irrespective of scan platform orientation; it also\n        allowed the detectors to all be approximately the same\n        distance from the telescope optic axis.  In this application\n        thermopiles were found to be better than other thermal\n        detectors because they operate to dc and exhibit no 1/f\n        noise.  Thus, no optical chopper is needed.  Also, no bias\n        supply, another potential source of 1/f noise, is needed.\n        Cooled quantum detectors were not practical, considering the\n        duration and weight constraints of the Viking Mission.  The\n        array was made by evaporating the various components onto a\n        sapphire film using photoetched masks for dimensional\n        control.  The film, about 200 nm thick, is supported by a\n        sapphire disk.  The film was made by anodizing aluminum foil\n        and etching away the aluminum.  The black circular dots in\n        the figure are the sensitive areas overlaid with bismuth\n        oxide smoke which has good ir absorptivity but low thermal\n        mass.

At\n        other times the detector packages were backfilled with xenon\n        to protect the detectors while still allowing gross\n        sensitivity checks.  To avoid exposure to moisture during the\n        long period prior to launch when the IRTM was mounted on the\n        spacecraft and could not be sealed, the manifold was kept at\n        a slight positive pressure by a continuous flow of high\n        purity nitrogen.  The manifold was opened to space by launch\n        vehicle separation.\n \n \n      Sensitivity\n      -----------\n        The detectivity is 2.E8 CM_HZ**0.5_W**-1\n \n \n    Instrument Electronics 'IRTM'\n    =============================\n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The signal channels use a synchronous demodulation scheme to\n        provide good stability and to avoid 1/f noise in the preamp.\n        The input FET chopper is a full-wave type operating at 471\n        Hz.  This and the center-tapped thermopile allow voltage\n        doubling of the detector signal and noise and thus reduce the\n        preamp noise contribution which otherwise would be\n        significant.  The differential input connection, while\n        suffering a square root (2) noise disadvantage compared to\n        single-ended input, provides excellent common mode rejection\n        of chopper spikes and other input noise.  Temperature\n        dependence of the thermopile, about -0.5%/degree C., is\n        compensated by a thermister network external to the hybrid\n        package.  Preamp gain is adjustable with an external\n        resistor.  Following the half-wave synchronous demodulator is\n        an integrate, hold, and reset circuit with an integrate time\n        of 981 msec.  The integrator serves as a low pass filter\n        while the hold feature ensures spatial simultaneity of\n        corresponding detectors in each telescope.  After completion\n        of sampling by the multiplexer, all channel hold circuits are\n        reset to ensure independence of data samples.  The IRTM\n        analog signals, which have a range of +/- 6V, are digitized\n        by the analog-to-pulse width converter and flight data\n        subsystem (FDS) counter into +/- 2**9 levels, yielding 1023\n        data numbers (DN) which are nearly linear with radiance in\n        each channel.  The IRTM multiplexer consists of sixty-eight\n        FET switches and a buffer signal amplifier.  In addition to\n        thirty-two data channels (twenty-eight active and four\n        spare), thirty-two channels of engineering data are also\n        sample.  These include eight temperature measurements from\n        thermisters located at four locations on the reference plate,\n        the electronics module, and each of the three ir detector\n        packages (telescopes A, B, C).  Three power supply voltages\n        and the pre-dc restore voltage of twenty-one channels\n        (telescopes A, B, and C) are monitored.  The pre-dc restore\n        monitors are diagnostic to determine the presence of large\n        thermal or detector offsets.  The scan mirror is driven by a\n        four-position stepper motor through a 50/1 gear reduction.  A\n        motor drive pulse duration of 40 msec allows a 90 degree\n        mirror rotation in 2 sec.  The mirror position is sensed by a\n        two-bit encoder on the motor shaft; the contacts at the three\n        desired positions are about half of the width of 1.8 degree\n        mirror step.  The motor stepping is controlled by the FDS\n        using a comparison of the encoder readout with the desired\n        position originating either from the FDS normal mode clock or\n        direct ground command; the motor cannot be directly\n        commanded.  In addition to the restore which occurs\n        automatically in the normal model when the mirror reaches the\n        space position, restores can be ground commanded when the\n        IRTM is in the fixed planet or fixed space mode; in either\n        case housekeeping data are multiplexed into the data stream\n        during the 1-sec restore period.  Whenever the mirror reaches\n        the reference position, the calibration lamp is turned on for\n        the next two integration periods.  The lamp is at full\n        radiance throughout the second integration period, which is\n        used for gain determination of the D telescope channels.  In\n        the fixed reference mode, science and housekeeping data are\n        sampled alternatively.\n \n \n    Instrument Filter 'A - T20'\n    ===========================\n      Filter Name                    : T20\n      Filter Type                    : RESTSTRAHLEN\n      Minimum Wavelength             : 17.700000\n      Maximum Wavelength             : 30.000000\n      Center Filter Wavelength       : 21.000000\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        Relative spectral response of all channels was measured end\n        to end using a Perkin-Elmer 16 U monochrometer with\n        appropriate gratings and order filters.  A globar at 1400 K\n        was used in the 2-25 micrometer range; shortward of 2.0\n        micrometers a tungsten source at 2700 K was used.  The\n        reference detector was a thermocouple for all but the 0.4-1.1\n        micrometer range, where a calibrated silicon photodiode was\n        used.  Out-of-band measurements were made by replacing the\n        spectrometer grating with a plane mirror and ir materials\n        having known cutoff and cuton wavelengths.  Flux calibration\n        of the IRTM was performed under a simulated space environment\n        using a vacuum chamber operated typically at a pressure of\n        1.E-6 Torr.  The IRTM was operated by means of a console\n        which simulated the interfaces and functions of the\n        spacecraft FDS.  A minicomputer was used to provide all\n        operational sequences and modes.  Data were recorded on\n        magnetic tape for subsequent computer processing.  The\n        calibration fixture consisted of two identical blackbodies,\n        one located in front of the space port and maintained at\n        liquid nitrogen temperature and the other in front of the\n        plant port and adjustable in temperature from 77 K to 350K;\n        eleven settings from 140 K to 330 K were used.  Blackbody\n        temperatures were measured with platinum resistance\n        thermometers having an absolute accuracy of +/- 0.1 degrees\n        C.  traceable to the National Bureau of Standards.  The\n        digitizer used in the test console provided ten times the\n        resolution of the FDS digitizer, thus making the digitizing\n        uncertainty during calibration insignificant compared to the\n        noise.  The calibration data thus produced are IRTM output in\n        digitization level (DN) as a function of blackbody\n        temperature.  Radiometrically measured internal reference\n        surface temperatures showed close agreement (+/- 0.5 degrees\n        C.) with those measured independently with a thermister.  The\n        IRTM temperature was controlled by regulating the temperature\n        of a mounting base plate and the thermal shield inside the\n        vacuum chamber.  Calibration was performed at 10 degrees C.\n        spacing across the range of operating temperatures expected\n        during flight.  Typical IRTM channel response to scene\n        brightness temperatures is shown in Fig.  8 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The one-sample noise on the thermal\n        channels is less than 1 DN except for the 15 micrometer\n        channel where it is about 2.5 DN.

The\n        digitizer used in the test console provided ten times the\n        resolution of the FDS digitizer, thus making the digitizing\n        uncertainty during calibration insignificant compared to the\n        noise.  The calibration data thus produced are IRTM output in\n        digitization level (DN) as a function of blackbody\n        temperature.

It is an f/3.5, 20.3-cm focal\n        length Cassegrainian design with an aperture diameter of\n        5.8-cm., spherical surfaces, and, except for mirror\n        materials, is identical to the B and C telescopes.  By using\n        relatively slow fore optics, degradation of filter sharpness\n        normally caused by operating an interference filter in a low\n        f-number beam is negligible.  The focal plane contains a\n        field-defining aperture plate with seven 0.107-cm diameter\n        holes arranged in a chevron pattern.  The fields of view thus\n        defined are nested with those of the MAWD and imaging systems\n        (Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978).  Behind each hole in the field\n        stop plate is a lens which produces a 0.0254-cm diam image of\n        the telescope aperture on the detector, which itself is about\n        the same size.  The final optical speed at the detector is\n        f/1.  Optical materials used in the four telescopes are shown\n        in Table II, and the resulting spectral response is shown in\n        Fig.  5 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  Mirrors are made of hot-pressed\n        uncoated zinc oxide for both primary and secondary mirrors.\n        The reststrahlen reflection properties of ZnO are the major\n        factors in the A telescope spectral response.  Minimizing\n        extrafield sensitivity (EFS) was an important aspect of the\n        optical design since on previous Mariner radiometers EFS\n        contribution seriously compromised observations of scenes\n        near large temperature contrasts (points near the planetary\n        limb and polar caps).  During instrumentation development,\n        IRTM image quality was determined in two angular regions.  In\n        the near-field region, a laboratory collimator and ir source\n        were used to measure the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad\n        diam (three fields of view).  Point source field of view\n        measurements in this region are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far field measurements, sensitivity\n        constraints dictated an approach in which the fraction of\n        energy within a given angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm\n        diam, concentric grooved, blackbody plate with a series of\n        restricting apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm,\n        140-cm, and 610-cm) to define angular response regions from\n        about one field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the\n        telescope focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at\n        that distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2\n        mrad).  The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a\n        heater/regulator and integral water jacket.  To prevent\n        difficulties with atmospheric transmission, the entire\n        apparatus was contained in a polyethylene bag flushed with\n        dry N2.  The EFS problem was more severe for the longer\n        wavelength A telescope than the others, possibly owing to the\n        higher reflectance at longer wavelengths of the black paint\n        used inside the telescope.  Tests using this apparatus led to\n        several telescope modifications designed to reduce EFS (see\n        Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal baffle was\n        placed between the field lens and the detectors to confine\n        energy to the sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A spider\n        baffle, added to the outer edges of the secondary mirror\n        support spider, was designed to reduce reflection off the\n        sides of the spider legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with CTL\n        15 black paint was placed on the central dead spot of the\n        secondary mirror.  This was designed to prevent focal plane\n        reflections from falling on the detectors.  Of these three\n        modifications, only the cone baffle gave significant\n        improvement, although all three were incorporated in the\n        design.  These results of the final EFS measurements are\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response\n        due to diffraction and the measured values are shown.  The\n        integrated EFS response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was\n        about 4%.  Of this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.\n        The effect of response outside of the nominal field of view\n        can be estimated directly from data obtained on scans across\n        the hot (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the\n        response is circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates\n        this to be closely followed, the signature of a half space\n        would also be symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived\n        from a Viking 1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was\n        determined using a 20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate\n        all four telescopes with a small source of high temperature\n        blackbody radiation.  Measurements were taken simultaneously\n        in twenty-eight channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.\n        For each channel, a parabolic ellipsoid was fit to data where\n        the measured intensity was more than 10% of the peak\n        intensity in that channel.  The alignment of each telescope\n        was ascertained by combining the center of response so\n        determined for the seven channels in the telescope.  This\n        procedure allowed for the alignment of the four telescopes to\n        be determined with an estimated precision of 0.1 mrad.  The\n        back of the secondary mirror of the B telescope was\n        aluminized and used as the alignment reference for this\n        procedure and for instrument alignment on the spacecraft.\n        The instrument pointing direction was verified in the same\n        manner just prior to planetary encounter using Mars as a\n        5-mrad diam source and using the science platform motion to\n        generate a 5-mrad spaced grid.  The in-flight alignment is\n        shown in Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n \n \n    Instrument Optics 'B'\n    =====================\n      Telescope Diameter             : 0.058000\n      Telescope F Number             : 3.500000\n      Telescope Focal Length         : 0.203000\n      Telescope Resolution           : 0.005100\n      Telescope T Number             : UNK\n      Telescope Transmittance        : UNK\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The A telescope (17.7-24 micrometer) is shown schematically\n        in Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.

The\n        out-of-band response for the B telescope is less than 0.1% of\n        full scale for an object of 1.E-6 the radiance of a 5800-K\n        blackbody, the level expected for reflectance from the\n        subsolar region of Mars.  Minimizing extrafield sensitivity\n        (EFS) was an important aspect of the optical design since on\n        previous Mariner radiometers EFS contribution seriously\n        compromised observations of scenes near large temperature\n        contrasts (points near the planetary limb and polar caps).\n        During instrumentation development, IRTM image quality was\n        determined in two angular regions.  In the near-field region,\n        a laboratory collimator and ir source were used to measure\n        the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad diam (three fields of\n        view).  Point source field of view measurements in this\n        region are shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far\n        field measurements, sensitivity constraints dictated an\n        approach in which the fraction of energy within a given\n        angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm diam, concentric\n        grooved, blackbody plate with a series of restricting\n        apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm, 140-cm, and\n        610-cm) to define angular response regions from about one\n        field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the telescope\n        focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at that\n        distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2 mrad).\n        The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a heater/regulator\n        and integral water jacket.  To prevent difficulties with\n        atmospheric transmission, the entire apparatus was contained\n        in a polyethylene bag flushed with dry N2.  Tests using this\n        apparatus led to several telescope modifications designed to\n        reduce EFS (see Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal\n        baffle was placed between the field lens and the detectors to\n        confine energy to the sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A\n        spider baffle, added to the outer edges of the secondary\n        mirror support spider, was designed to reduce reflection off\n        the sides of the spider legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with\n        CTL 15 black paint was placed on the central dead spot of the\n        secondary mirror.  This was designed to prevent focal plane\n        reflections from falling on the detectors.  Of these three\n        modifications, only the cone baffle gave significant\n        improvement, although all three were incorporated in the\n        design.  These results of the final EFS measurements are\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response\n        due to diffraction and the measured values are shown.  The\n        integrated EFS response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was\n        about 4%.  Of this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.\n        The effect of response outside of the nominal field of view\n        can be estimated directly from data obtained on scans across\n        the hot (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the\n        response is circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates\n        this to be closely followed, the signature of a half space\n        would also be symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived\n        from a Viking 1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was\n        determined using a 20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate\n        all four telescopes with a small source of high temperature\n        blackbody radiation.  Measurements were taken simultaneously\n        in twenty-eight channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.\n        For each channel, a parabolic ellipsoid was fit to data where\n        the measured intensity was more than 10% of the peak\n        intensity in that channel.  The alignment of each telescope\n        was ascertained by combining the center of response so\n        determined for the seven channels in the telescope.  This\n        procedure allowed by the alignment of the four telescopes to\n        be determined with an estimated precision of 0.1 mrad.  The\n        back of the secondary mirror of the B telescope was\n        aluminized and used as the alignment reference for this\n        procedure and for instrument alignment on the spacecraft.\n        The instrument pointing direction was verified in the same\n        manner just prior to planetary encounter using Mars as a\n        5-mrad diam source and using the science platform motion to\n        generate a 5-mrad spaced grid.  The in-flight alignment is\n        shown in Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n \n \n    Instrument Optics 'C'\n    =====================\n      Telescope Diameter             : 0.058000\n      Telescope F Number             : 3.500000\n      Telescope Focal Length         : 0.203000\n      Telescope Resolution           : 0.005100\n      Telescope T Number             : UNK\n      Telescope Transmittance        : UNK\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The A telescope (17.7-24 micrometer) is shown schematically\n        in Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  It is an f/3.5, 20.3-cm focal\n        length Cassegrainian design with an aperture diameter of\n        5.8-cm., spherical surfaces, and, except for mirror\n        materials, is identical to the B and C telescopes.  The focal\n        plane contains a field-defining aperture plate with seven\n        0.107-cm diameter holes arranged in a chevron pattern.  The\n        fields of view thus defined are nested with those of the MAWD\n        and imaging systems (Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978).  Behind\n        each hole in the field stop plate is a lens which produces a\n        0.0254-cm diam image of the telescope aperture on the\n        detector, which itself is about the same size.  The final\n        optical speed at the detector is f/1.  Optical materials used\n        in the four telescopes are shown in Table II, and the\n        resulting spectral response is shown in Fig.  5 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  Mirrors are made of aluminized and SiO\n        overcoated fused silica except for the A telescope, which\n        uses hot-pressed uncoated zinc oxide for both primary and\n        secondary mirrors.  The spectral bandpass of the other ir\n        channels is determined by interference bandpass filters and\n        AR coated detector lenses.  The out-of-band response for the\n        B and C telescopes is less than 0.1% of full scale for an\n        object of 1.E-6 the radiance of a 5800-K blackbody, the level\n        expected for reflectance from the subsolar region of Mars.\n        The A band has less than 0.1% response for wavelengths less\n        than 16 micrometer, and wavelengths longer than 30 micrometer\n        are limited by the Irtran 6 field lens.  Minimizing\n        extrafield sensitivity (EFS) was an important aspect of the\n        optical design since on previous Mariner radiometers EFS\n        contribution seriously compromised observations of scenes\n        near large temperature contrasts (points near the planetary\n        limb and polar caps).  During instrumentation development,\n        IRTM image quality was determined in two angular regions.  In\n        the near-field region, a laboratory collimator and ir source\n        were used to measure the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad\n        diam (three fields of view).  Point source field of view\n        measurements in this region are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far field measurements, sensitivity\n        constraints dictated an approach in which the fraction of\n        energy within a given angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm\n        diam, concentric grooved, blackbody plate with a series of\n        restricting apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm,\n        140-cm, and 610-cm) to define angular response regions from\n        about one field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the\n        telescope focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at\n        that distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2\n        mrad).  The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a\n        heater/regulator and integral water jacket.  To prevent\n        difficulties with atmospheric transmission, the entire\n        apparatus was contained in a polyethylene bag flushed with\n        dry N2.  Tests using this apparatus led to several telescope\n        modifications designed to reduce EFS (see Fig.  3 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal baffle was placed between\n        the field lens and the detectors to confine energy to the\n        sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A spider baffle, added\n        to the outer edges of the secondary mirror support spider,\n        was designed to reduce reflection off the sides of the spider\n        legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with CTL 15 black paint was\n        placed on the central dead spot of the secondary mirror.\n        This was designed to prevent focal plane reflections from\n        falling on the detectors.  Of these three modifications, only\n        the cone baffle gave significant improvement, although all\n        three were incorporated in the design.  These results of the\n        final EFS measurements are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response due to diffraction\n        and the measured values are shown.  The integrated EFS\n        response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was about 4%.  Of\n        this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.  The effect of\n        response outside of the nominal field of view can be\n        estimated directly from data obtained on scans across the hot\n        (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the response is\n        circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates this to be\n        closely followed, the signature of a half space would also be\n        symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived from a Viking\n        1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is shown in Fig.\n        6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was determined using a\n        20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate all four telescopes\n        with a small source of high temperature blackbody radiation.\n        Measurements were taken simultaneously in twenty-eight\n        channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.

The back\n        of the secondary mirror of the B telescope was aluminized and\n        used as the alignment reference for this procedure and for\n        instrument alignment on the spacecraft.  The instrument\n        pointing direction was verified in the same manner just prior\n        to planetary encounter using Mars as a 5-mrad diam source and\n        using the science platform motion to generate a 5-mrad spaced\n        grid.  The in-flight alignment is shown in Fig.  4 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.\n \n \n    Instrument Optics 'D'\n    =====================\n      Telescope Diameter             : 0.037000\n      Telescope F Number             : 5.500000\n      Telescope Focal Length         : 0.203000\n      Telescope Resolution           : UNK\n      Telescope T Number             : UNK\n      Telescope Transmittance        : UNK\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        The D telescope has a reduced aperture of 3.7 cm and a focal\n        length of f/5.5.  By using relatively slow fore optics,\n        degradation of filter sharpness normally caused by operating\n        an interference filter in a low f-number beam is negligible.\n        The focal plane contains a field-defining aperture plate with\n        seven 0.107-cm diam holes arranged in a chevron pattern.  The\n        fields of view thus defined are nested with those of the MAWD\n        and imaging systems (Fig.  4 of CHASE_ETAL_1978).  Behind\n        each hole in the field stop plate is a lens which produces a\n        0.0254-cm diam image of the telescope aperture on the\n        detector, which itself is about the same size.  The final\n        optical speed at the detector is f/1.  Optical materials used\n        in the four telescopes are shown in Table II, and the\n        resulting spectral response is shown in Fig.  5 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  Mirrors are made of aluminized and SiO\n        overcoated fused silica except for the A telescope, which\n        uses hot-pressed uncoated zinc oxide for both primary and\n        secondary mirrors.  The spectral bandpass of the other ir\n        channels is determined by interference bandpass filters and\n        AR coated detector lenses.  The transmission elements of the\n        D telescope insure that it is thermally blind.  Special\n        coatings on the D telescope mirrors were used to obtain a\n        reasonably gray response to solar radiation.  Minimizing\n        extrafield sensitivity (EFS) was an important aspect of the\n        optical design since on previous Mariner radiometers EFS\n        contribution seriously compromised observations of scenes\n        near large temperature contrasts (points near the planetary\n        limb and polar caps).  During instrumentation development,\n        IRTM image quality was determined in two angular regions.  In\n        the near-field region, a laboratory collimator and ir source\n        were used to measure the 2-D spatial response out to 16-mrad\n        diam (three fields of view).  Point source field of view\n        measurements in this region are shown in Fig.  6 of\n        CHASE_ETAL_1978.  For far field measurements, sensitivity\n        constraints dictated an approach in which the fraction of\n        energy within a given angular annulus is measured.  A 30.5-cm\n        diam, concentric grooved, blackbody plate with a series of\n        restricting apertures was used at several distances (30.5-cm,\n        140-cm, and 610-cm) to define angular response regions from\n        about one field of view out to 1-rad diam.  That is, with the\n        telescope focused at 610-cm, a disk 3.17-cm in diameter at\n        that distance defines one half-response field of view (5.2\n        mrad).  The source was held at 95 degrees C.  by a\n        heater/regulator and integral water jacket.  To prevent\n        difficulties with atmospheric transmission, the entire\n        apparatus was contained in a polyethylene bag flushed with\n        dry N2.  The EFS problem was more severe for the longer\n        wavelength A telescope than the others, possibly owing to the\n        higher reflectance at longer wavelengths of the black paint\n        used inside the telescope.  Tests using this apparatus led to\n        several telescope modifications designed to reduce EFS (see\n        Fig.  3 of CHASE_ETAL_1978): (1) A postfocal baffle was\n        placed between the field lens and the detectors to confine\n        energy to the sensitive area of the detectors.  (2) A spider\n        baffle, added to the outer edges of the secondary mirror\n        support spider, was designed to reduce reflection off the\n        sides of the spider legs.  (3) A cone baffle coated with CTL\n        15 black paint was placed on the central dead spot of the\n        secondary mirror.  This was designed to prevent focal plane\n        reflections from falling on the detectors.  Of these three\n        modifications, only the cone baffle gave significant\n        improvement, although all three were incorporated in the\n        design.  These results of the final EFS measurements are\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The calculated response\n        due to diffraction and the measured values are shown.  The\n        integrated EFS response between 12 mrad and 1-rad diam was\n        about 4%.  Of this, about 1/2 is due to diffraction effects.\n        The effect of response outside of the nominal field of view\n        can be estimated directly from data obtained on scans across\n        the hot (subsolar) planetary limb.  Assuming that the\n        response is circularly symmetric, and all evidence indicates\n        this to be closely followed, the signature of a half space\n        would also be symmetric.  A plot of fractional energy derived\n        from a Viking 1 IRTM scan across the sunlit limb of Mars is\n        shown in Fig.  6 of CHASE_ETAL_1978.  The alignment was\n        determined using a 20.3-cm (8-in.) collimator to illuminate\n        all four telescopes with a small source of high temperature\n        blackbody radiation.  Measurements were taken simultaneously\n        in twenty-eight channels over a 1.5-mrad square grid pattern.\n        For each channel, a parabolic ellipsoid was fit to data where\n        the measured intensity was more than 10% of the peak\n        intensity in that channel.  The alignment of each telescope\n        was ascertained by combining the center of response so\n        determined for the seven channels in the telescope.  This\n        procedure allowed by the alignment of the four telescopes to\n        be determined with an estimated precision of 0.1 mrad.  The\n        instrument pointing direction was verified in the same manner\n        just prior to planetary encounter using Mars as a 5-mrad diam\n        source and using the science platform motion to generate a\n        5-mrad spaced grid.

The REFERENCE position was\n        also the 'safe' position, used when the instrument was turned\n        off.\n \n        A MODIFIED normal mode was also available, in which the only\n        space view was the first of the cycle, followed by 243 ICKs\n        of planet data.  In NORMAL mode, ICKs 1 and 2 were\n        housekeeping data while the mirror moved to space.  ICK 3 was\n        the space level before reset.  During ICK 4, the electronics\n        for all channels were reset so that the sensed radiance\n        (meant to be the cosmic background level of essentially zero\n        radiance) yielded a data number (DN) of a few.  There was a\n        filter on the reset so that the voltage change was only about\n        2/3 of the way to the space radiance level; this smoothed out\n        the zero setting, but also meant that several cycles were\n        required to recover from a serious drift.  ICK 5 was still in\n        the space position and yielded the DN response to space.  Ick\n        6 and 7 were housekeeping data while the mirror moved to the\n        reference position.  ICK 8 and 9 were the DN response to the\n        reference surface; only the second reading was used in\n        calibration of the solar channel to allow the lamp filament\n        to warm up completely.  ICKs 10 through 13 were housekeeping\n        data while the mirror moved to the planet position.  The 57\n        ICKs 14-64 were planet data.  The 7 ICK cycle to space, with\n        reset of the zero-radiance DN level in all channels, was\n        repeated each 64 ICKs, beginning on ICKs 65, 129, and 193,\n        with motion directly back to the planet position for another\n        57 ICKs of planet data.\n \n \n    Instrument Mode 'NORMAL'\n    ========================\n      Instrument Power Consumption : 6.000000\n \n \n      In sections\n      -----------\n        IRTM\n \n \n      Description\n      -----------\n        Other than power on or power off, the only command options\n        for the IRTM controlled the motion of the scan mirror.  This\n        mirror could be commanded to 3 positions, separated by 90\n        degrees; PLANET, SPACE, and REFERENCE.  In the PLANET\n        position, data were acquired in all 28 channels.  In SPACE,\n        the zero-radiance level was reset to near the bottom of the\n        dynamic range.  In the REFERENCE position, gain calibration\n        data was obtained using both a grooved blackbody at ambient\n        instrument temperature and a small lamp and hemispherical\n        diffuser for the solar telescope.

ICK is a one syllable\n        acronym for 'incremental counter keeper' and represents 1.12\n        second duration, the basic time interval of IRTM operation.\n        It required 2 ICKs for the mirror to move 90 degrees and\n        settle; whenever the mirror was in motion the downlink data\n        contained housekeeping information about instrument status\n        and detector voltage levels.\n \n        In NORMAL mode, ICKs 1 and 2 were housekeeping data while the\n        mirror moved to space.  ICK 3 was the space level before\n        reset.  During ICK 4, the electronics for all channels were\n        reset so that the sensed radiance (meant to be the cosmic\n        background level of essentially zero radiance) yielded a data\n        number (DN) of a few.

The VMIS\n      consists of three major assemblies:\n \n      1) The Meteorology Sensor Array (MSA), which supports\n      the wind and temperature sensors and provides a housing\n      for the low-level electronics.\n      2) The Meteorology Boom Assembly (MBA), which provides\n      the means for positioning the MSA after landing.\n      Following deployment of the MBA, the MSA is positioned\n      nominally 1.6 meters above the ground, 0.7 meter above\n      the top of the Lander body, and about 0.3 meter\n      horizontally outward from the closest portion of the\n      Lander body.\n      3) The Meteorology Electronic Assembly (MEA), which\n      provides power to the sensors and conditions the\n      signals from the sensors so that the proper interface\n      with the Lander electronic system is maintained.\n \n      The individual sensors are described below (see\n      CHAMBERLAIN_ETAL1976):\n \n      The ambient pressure sensor is located in the Lander body near\n      the MEA and has an external pressure line running to a port on\n      the bottom plate of the Lander body.  The sensor is a\n      stretched-diaphragm-type variable reluctance transducer that\n      operates over a range of 0 to 18 millibars.\n \n      The ambient temperature sensor consists of three\n      Chromel-Constantan thermocouples wired in parallel.  It is\n      capable of measuring over the entire range of expected martian\n      temperatures with an accuracy of about 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n \n      The reference temperature sensor was a platinum resistance\n      thermometer mounted between the wind speed elements (see\n      below).\n \n      Wind speed is measured by means of two hot film anemometers\n      oriented orthogonal to each other and lying in the horizontal\n      plane.  These hot film elements were maintained at a nominal\n      overheat temperature of 100 degrees Celsius above the air\n      temperature measured by the reference temperature sensor.  The\n      power required to maintain each anemometer at the specified\n      temperature was a function of the component of the wind speed\n      orthogonal to the element.\n \n      The wind speed sensors also measure wind direction, but with a\n      fourfold ambiguity.  Selection of the proper quadrant is\n      accomplished by a quadrant sensor, consisting of a heated\n      cylindrical platinum core (maintained at a 100 degrees Celsius\n      overheat) surrounded by four thermocouple junctions at equal\n      angles and distance from the core.  Thermocouples on opposite\n      sides of the post comprised a thermocouple pair which was\n      connected in series, allowing for measurement of the\n      temperature differences across each pair.  These differences\n      resulted from the thermal wake in the lee of the heated center\n      core.  The quadrant sensor values were functions, though not\n      single-valued, of wind speed.  The redundant wind speed and\n      directional information provided by both the wind speed and\n      quadrant sensors was combined using a least squares technique\n      to give the best estimates of wind speed and direction.\n \n \n    Science Objectives\n    ==================\n      The scientific objectives of the Viking Meteorology Instrument\n      System (VMIS) are:\n \n      DETECTION OF MEDIUM- AND SMALL-SCALE SYSTEMS: The length scales\n      associated with convective processes (thermals, dust devils)\n      and mesoscale processes (fronts, small dust storms) are\n      considerably greater than the length scales that can be\n      measured by the Lander.  These atmospheric systems can be\n      detected and studied by the VMIS only when they pass the\n      Landers and then only if the VMIS is taking data at the time\n      the system passes.  It is an objective of the VMIS to measure\n      the passage of such systems and to study their structures.\n \n      MEASUREMENT OF SYNOPTIC- AND PLANETARY-SCALE SYSTEMS: With just\n      two observation points, it will not be possible to study the\n      structure of atmospheric systems on a planetary scale.  It will\n      be possible, however, to determine some parameters about the\n      general circulation that can provide useful constraints on\n      theory.  Examples are measurements of large-scale winds,\n      diurnal variations, and annual variations of atmospheric\n      conditions.\n \n      DETERMINATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYER:\n      An objective of the VMIS is to measure temperature, wind speed,\n      and wind direction in the turbulent boundary layer to\n      understand better the vertical transport of properties such as\n      momentum and heat throughout the diurnal cycle.\n \n      MEASUREMENT OF THE LOCAL ENVIORNMENT: It is an objective to\n      determine the meteorological environment in which the Landers\n      operate and how that environment varies diurnally, seasonally,\n      and annually.\n \n      SUPPORT OF OTHER EXPERIMENTS: Measurements made by VMIS may aid\n      in the analysis of data obtained by other Lander experiments.\n      For example, wind gusts can shake the Lander and cause spurious\n      signals to be generated by the seismometer.  Measurements of\n      wind speed and direction may aid in analyzing images of clouds\n      (dust and condensate), and temperature data will aid in\n      interpretation of observations of condensates.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Problems with the ambient temperature sensor on Lander 2 were\n      noted shortly before launch.  The readings exhibited a\n      temperature-dependent error, increasing as Lander body\n      temperature decreased.  The error gradually decreased after\n      power-up of the electronics, approaching a steady-state value\n      after 30-40 minutes of operation.  Analysis of the landed data\n      and comparison with the reference temperature sensors on both\n      Landers and the ambient temperature sensor on Lander 1\n      permitted a suitable correction to be applied.  This required\n      that power be left on continuously to eliminate drift.  This\n      was done from Lander 2 sol 25 onward.  The corrections to the\n      Lander 2 ambient temperature sensor limit its accuracy to about\n      3 degrees Celsius (see HESS_ETAL_1977).\n \n \n    Calibration Description\n    =======================\n      The Viking Meteorology Instrument System (VMIS), including\n      software, was subjected to an extensive test program at the\n      Langley Research Center.  The instrument was tested over the\n      anticipated range of Martian wind speeds (directions 0 to 360\n      degrees) and at temperatures as low as 200 degrees Kelvin.  The\n      data from these tests were reduced using the flight software,\n      and the results were compared to facility parameters that were\n      reduced independently.  These tests indicate that the VMIS\n      (including software, but not accounting for Lander flow-field\n      effects) has an accuracy of about 10% in wind speed, 10% in\n      wind direction, and 1.5 degree Kelvin in temperature.\n \n      The pressure transducers were calibrated to approximately 0.01\n      to 0.02 millibars accuracy over the ranges expected for martian\n      atmospheric pressure variation.  Calibrations to accuracies\n      greater than allowed by the digitizing system were accomplished\n      by test support instrumentation.  Repeatability from year to\n      year of the daily average pressures indicates that the\n      transducers have remained stable to significantly better than\n      0.04 millibars throughout the mission, possibly maintaining\n      stabilities on the order of 0.01 millibars.\n \n      It should be noted that the Meteorology Boom Assembly was\n      positioned on the Lander to minimize the effects of the\n      Lander-induced flow field.  The Lander effect is about 10% in\n      wind direction and 10% in wind speed and is a function of wind\n      direction and possibly local terrain.  Turbulence and other\n      effects will further contribute to instrument error.

Under ground command, the sampling rate, duration\n        over which a given sampling rate is maintained, the serial\n        sequence of sampling rates and duration, the time between\n        sampling sequences, the times and frequencies of sampling\n        initiation, and the total amount of data taken per martian\n        day (sol) can be varied.  Prior to landing, preplanned\n        sequences were loaded into each Lander.  These consisted of\n        modules with durations of of about 9, 20, and 39 minutes\n        spaced nominally 1.5 hours apart throughout the sol.\n        Intervals between individual samples were 4 and 8 seconds for\n        the 9 minute modules, 4 seconds for the 39 minute modules,\n        and 2 seconds for the 20 minute modules.  One complete\n        sequence consisted of 18 modules.  Sixteen of these were 9\n        minutes long and two, spaced about 12 hours apart, were of\n        longer duration (one being 39 minutes long, the other 20\n        minutes long).  The 18 periods were spaced so as to occupy\n        somewhat more than a sol.  As a result, the pattern of\n        sequences stepped ahead about 1.5 hours each sol.  This\n        survey mode was adopted in order to define the diurnal cycle\n        while moving long sequences through the sol, thus permitting\n        a study of fluctuation characteristics at all portions of the\n        diurnal cycle.\n \n        Later in the mission, extended periods of rapid sampling\n        (about 1 second intervals) were included to study boundary\n        layer characteristics at as high a sampling rate as the\n        system would allow.  In addition, various alterations were\n        made in sampling rates, durations, and measurement periods to\n        determine an optimal pattern for sampling the martian\n        atmosphere.  It became evident that the total science return\n        would be maximized by taking samples nearly continuously but\n        at rates slow enough to satisfy mission constraints on total\n        meteorology data.

The lander camera was a\n      facsimile camera with a single, stationary photosensor array\n      (PSA) and azimuth and elevation scanning mechanisms.  A lander\n      image was generated by scanning the scene in two directions\n      (azimuth and elevation) to focus light onto the photosensor\n      array.  A number of published papers described the\n      characteristics and performance of the lander cameras.  The\n      scientific rational and early design of the cameras were\n      described in Mutch et al.  [1972] and a detailed description of\n      the flight cameras was given in Huck et al. [1975b].  Huck and\n      Wall [1976] discussed image quality and Patterson et al.\n      [1977] described camera performance during the Primary Mission.\n      A summary of the information from these papers is given here as\n      a high-level description of the camera and its operating modes.\n \n \n    Platform Mounting Descriptions\n    ==============================\n      Each camera was bolted to the top of the lander body.  The\n      camera had a lower stationary section containing electronics\n      and an upper section that rotated in azimuth (i.e., around a\n      vertical axis).  The other prominent exterior component was a\n      post assembly that protected the camera window from the Mars\n      environment when the camera was not in use.  At the top of the\n      post was a carbon dioxide dust removal nozzle.  Major internal\n      camera components were two fused silica windows, a mirror,\n      elevation and azimuth rotation assemblies, a lens, the\n      photosensor array, electronics, and pinlights for calibration.\n      The overall camera height was 55.6 cm.  The lower assembly\n      diameter was 25.6 cm and the upper assembly diameter was 14.4\n      cm.  The weight of the camera was 7.26 kg.  Below is a table\n      that lists the serial number of the cameras and photosensor\n      arrays as they were assigned to the flight cameras [Huck et\n      al., 1975a].\n \n      Camera                  Serial Number  PSA Serial Number\n      --------------------------------------------------------\n      Viking 1, camera 1      FC-1B               M017\n \n      Viking 1, camera 2      FC-2A               M020\n \n      Viking 2, camera 1      FC-3A               M015\n \n      Viking 2, camera 2      SPARE               M019\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      The camera had several features to deal with possible dust\n      abrasion or obscuration.  When the camera was not in use, the\n      upper assembly was rotated so that the window was behind the\n      post assembly to prevent exposure to dust.  Mounted in the post\n      was a nozzle for releasing carbon dioxide gas to blow dust off\n      the window.  In addition, the outer window, known as the\n      contamination cover, was designed to move out of the optical\n      path if it became abraded or dust coated.  The contamination\n      cover window was hinged and spring loaded so that it could be\n      deployed by rotating the camera behind the post with enough\n      force to release the spring lever.  During the Extended Mission\n      the contamination cover windows of camera 1 on lander 1 and\n      camera 2 on lander 2 were deployed.  One drawback of the\n      contamination cover window was that its frame caused a\n      vignetting effect at elevation angles above 25 deg.  [Patterson\n      et al., 1977].\n \n      Light entered the camera through the windows, reflected off the\n      mirror toward the lens, passed through the lens, and was sensed\n      by one of the photodiodes.  A voltage was generated in the\n      selected photodiode that was digitized by an analog-to-digital\n      (A/D) converter.  Below the lens was a black shutter that could\n      be closed to sample photodiode dark current and to perform\n      internal radiometric calibration.  Between the lens and\n      photosensor array was a light baffle to minimize internal\n      reflections.  The lens had a 0.95 cm aperture diameter and 5.37\n      cm focal length.\n \n      Mechanical scanning was done by rotating the mirror around a\n      horizontal axis to scan each vertical line in an image.  The\n      entire upper camera assembly rotated around a vertical axis to\n      scan successive lines.  Image data were collected while the\n      mirror rotated up through the elevation range in 512 steps\n      (i.e., pixels were sampled from the bottom of the image to the\n      top).  The mirror rapidly rotated down to the start position\n      while the camera turned in azimuth for the next scan.  The\n      mirror could rotate from 60 deg below the horizon to 40 deg\n      above it for a total range of 100 deg.  The camera could see\n      342.5 deg in azimuth with the range limited by the post\n      assembly.  Image commands specified both a start and stop\n      azimuth such that the width of images varied.  On receiving a\n      command to acquire an image, the camera first rotated to a\n      preset azimuth and then rotated to the start azimuth.  The\n      camera stepped in azimuth after each vertical scan until the\n      stop azimuth was reached.  The sequence ended by the camera\n      moving back to the preset position and then to the park\n      position with the window behind the post.  The preset position\n      at the beginning and end of the sequence prevented the camera\n      from turning through mechanical stops.  Internal radiometric\n      calibration could be done by closing the shutter while the\n      camera was in the preset position either before or after the\n      image data were acquired.  The camera had two scanning rates so\n      that data could be collected at 250 or 16,000 bits/sec.\n \n      The photosensor array consisted of 12 silicon photodiodes (or\n      diodes) sensitive to light between 0.4 and 1.1 micrometers.\n      The diodes were arranged in a 2x6 array.  There were four broad\n      band, high resolution (0.04 deg angular resolution) diodes,\n      known as BB1, BB2, BB3, and BB4.  The distance between the lens\n      and each high resolution diode was different to vary the\n      in-focus distance of each diode.  In-focus distances were 1.9,\n      3.7, 4.5, and 13.3 meters for BB1, BB2, BB3, an BB4,\n      respectively.  There was a low resolution (0.12 deg angular\n      resolution), broad band diode known as the SURVEY diode.  There\n      were also six narrow band, low resolution diodes for color\n      (BLUE, GREEN, and RED) and infrared (IR1, IR2, and IR3) images.\n      The narrow bandwidth was generated by covering diodes with a\n      set of interference filters, chosen to survive the spacecraft\n      sterilization process.  The interference filters had\n      significant out-of-band leaks.  Also, the infrared filters were\n      known to degrade due to neutron radiation from the lander RTGs\n      [Patterson et al., 1977].  The twelfth diode was also a low\n      resolution diode covered by a red filter for imaging the Sun.\n      The in-focus distance for the low resolution diodes was about\n      3.7 meters.\n \n      Diodes in the camera generated a voltage proportional to\n      incoming radiance.  Each diode, except for the SUN diode, had\n      an amplifier to enhance the voltage signal.  The SUN diode did\n      not need an amplifier because of the strong signal when\n      directly viewing the Sun.  Voltage from the amplifier was\n      digitized as a 6-bit number in an A/D converter that also\n      performed automatic dark current subtraction.  Dark current was\n      sampled after every line in slow scan mode and after every 64th\n      line in rapid scan mode.  The A/D converter had 6 gains and 32\n      offsets so that the full dynamic range of the diode output\n      could be stored in 6-bits.  Gain defined the voltage range\n      sampled and its resolution.  Low gain (high gain number)\n      covered a wide range in voltage and had low voltage resolution.\n      The offset could be varied from a slightly negative voltage to\n      several volts in 32 small steps.  Digital values from the A/D\n      converter could be dumped to the spacecraft tape recorder or\n      transmitted to Earth or an orbiter in real-time (usually done\n      at beginning or end of a transmission link when the bit error\n      rate was relatively high).\n \n      Each camera had two pinlights in the post assembly.  Using a\n      special command, the lights turned on and an image was acquired\n      while viewing the pinlights.  This command, known as a scan\n      verification, monitored the mechanical scanning operation of\n      the camera.  A third pinlight with four different radiance\n      levels was located between the dark current shutter and the\n      photosensor array.  This pinlight was used with the shutter\n      closed for radiometric calibration of the camera.\n \n \n    Operation and Sampling Modes\n    ============================\n      Operation of Viking Lander cameras was versatile in that many\n      parameters for the image could be specified.  Commands to\n      acquire an image involved selecting the sampling mode, diode,\n      start and stop azimuths, center elevation, gain and offset,\n      scan rate, and specifying whether automatic dark current\n      subtraction, internal calibration, rescan, or dusting were\n      done.  Image start time and whether the image was transmitted\n      in real-time or sent to the tape recorder were also specified.\n \n      The camera had seven sampling modes: low resolution (0.12 deg)\n      stepping with three diodes (known as triplet mode); low\n      resolution stepping with one diode; high resolution (0.04 deg)\n      stepping with one diode; and four different calibration lamp\n      intensity levels.  In triplet mode, elevation scanning was\n      repeated three times with three different diodes at every\n      azimuth position.  An unusual sampling mode effect was an\n      elevation shift when the step size did not match the diode\n      resolution.  There was a -5.6 deg elevation shift when using a\n      low resolution diode with high resolution stepping and a +5.6\n      deg shift when using a high resolution diode with low\n      resolution stepping.  These non-nominal modes were mostly used\n      to generate high resolution color images or to better resolve\n      the solar disk.  For the triplet mode, the specified diode was\n      the first of the three diodes, e.g., BLUE diode for a color\n      image.

The lander camera was a\n      facsimile camera with a single, stationary photosensor array\n      (PSA) and azimuth and elevation scanning mechanisms.  A lander\n      image was generated by scanning the scene in two directions\n      (azimuth and elevation) to focus light onto the photosensor\n      array.  A number of published papers described the\n      characteristics and performance of the lander cameras.  The\n      scientific rational and early design of the cameras were\n      described in Mutch et al.  [1972] and a detailed description of\n      the flight cameras was given in Huck et al. [1975b].  Huck and\n      Wall [1976] discussed image quality and Patterson et al.\n      [1977] described camera performance during the Primary Mission.\n      A summary of the information from these papers is given here as\n      a high-level description of the camera and its operating modes.\n \n \n    Platform Mounting Descriptions\n    ==============================\n      Each camera was bolted to the top of the lander body.  The\n      camera had a lower stationary section containing electronics\n      and an upper section that rotated in azimuth (i.e., around a\n      vertical axis).  The other prominent exterior component was a\n      post assembly that protected the camera window from the Mars\n      environment when the camera was not in use.  At the top of the\n      post was a carbon dioxide dust removal nozzle.  Major internal\n      camera components were two fused silica windows, a mirror,\n      elevation and azimuth rotation assemblies, a lens, the\n      photosensor array, electronics, and pinlights for calibration.\n      The overall camera height was 55.6 cm.  The lower assembly\n      diameter was 25.6 cm and the upper assembly diameter was 14.4\n      cm.  The weight of the camera was 7.26 kg.  Below is a table\n      that lists the serial number of the cameras and photosensor\n      arrays as they were assigned to the flight cameras [Huck et\n      al., 1975a].\n \n      Camera                  Serial Number  PSA Serial Number\n      --------------------------------------------------------\n      Viking 1, camera 1      FC-1B               M017\n \n      Viking 1, camera 2      FC-2A               M020\n \n      Viking 2, camera 1      FC-3A               M015\n \n      Viking 2, camera 2      SPARE               M019\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      The camera had several features to deal with possible dust\n      abrasion or obscuration.  When the camera was not in use, the\n      upper assembly was rotated so that the window was behind the\n      post assembly to prevent exposure to dust.  Mounted in the post\n      was a nozzle for releasing carbon dioxide gas to blow dust off\n      the window.  In addition, the outer window, known as the\n      contamination cover, was designed to move out of the optical\n      path if it became abraded or dust coated.  The contamination\n      cover window was hinged and spring loaded so that it could be\n      deployed by rotating the camera behind the post with enough\n      force to release the spring lever.  During the Extended Mission\n      the contamination cover windows of camera 1 on lander 1 and\n      camera 2 on lander 2 were deployed.  One drawback of the\n      contamination cover window was that its frame caused a\n      vignetting effect at elevation angles above 25 deg.  [Patterson\n      et al., 1977].\n \n      Light entered the camera through the windows, reflected off the\n      mirror toward the lens, passed through the lens, and was sensed\n      by one of the photodiodes.  A voltage was generated in the\n      selected photodiode that was digitized by an analog-to-digital\n      (A/D) converter.  Below the lens was a black shutter that could\n      be closed to sample photodiode dark current and to perform\n      internal radiometric calibration.  Between the lens and\n      photosensor array was a light baffle to minimize internal\n      reflections.  The lens had a 0.95 cm aperture diameter and 5.37\n      cm focal length.\n \n      Mechanical scanning was done by rotating the mirror around a\n      horizontal axis to scan each vertical line in an image.  The\n      entire upper camera assembly rotated around a vertical axis to\n      scan successive lines.  Image data were collected while the\n      mirror rotated up through the elevation range in 512 steps\n      (i.e., pixels were sampled from the bottom of the image to the\n      top).  The mirror rapidly rotated down to the start position\n      while the camera turned in azimuth for the next scan.  The\n      mirror could rotate from 60 deg below the horizon to 40 deg\n      above it for a total range of 100 deg.  The camera could see\n      342.5 deg in azimuth with the range limited by the post\n      assembly.  Image commands specified both a start and stop\n      azimuth such that the width of images varied.  On receiving a\n      command to acquire an image, the camera first rotated to a\n      preset azimuth and then rotated to the start azimuth.  The\n      camera stepped in azimuth after each vertical scan until the\n      stop azimuth was reached.  The sequence ended by the camera\n      moving back to the preset position and then to the park\n      position with the window behind the post.  The preset position\n      at the beginning and end of the sequence prevented the camera\n      from turning through mechanical stops.  Internal radiometric\n      calibration could be done by closing the shutter while the\n      camera was in the preset position either before or after the\n      image data were acquired.  The camera had two scanning rates so\n      that data could be collected at 250 or 16,000 bits/sec.\n \n      The photosensor array consisted of 12 silicon photodiodes (or\n      diodes) sensitive to light between 0.4 and 1.1 micrometers.\n      The diodes were arranged in a 2x6 array.  There were four broad\n      band, high resolution (0.04 deg angular resolution) diodes,\n      known as BB1, BB2, BB3, and BB4.  The distance between the lens\n      and each high resolution diode was different to vary the\n      in-focus distance of each diode.  In-focus distances were 1.9,\n      3.7, 4.5, and 13.3 meters for BB1, BB2, BB3, an BB4,\n      respectively.  There was a low resolution (0.12 deg angular\n      resolution), broad band diode known as the SURVEY diode.  There\n      were also six narrow band, low resolution diodes for color\n      (BLUE, GREEN, and RED) and infrared (IR1, IR2, and IR3) images.\n      The narrow bandwidth was generated by covering diodes with a\n      set of interference filters, chosen to survive the spacecraft\n      sterilization process.  The interference filters had\n      significant out-of-band leaks.  Also, the infrared filters were\n      known to degrade due to neutron radiation from the lander RTGs\n      [Patterson et al., 1977].  The twelfth diode was also a low\n      resolution diode covered by a red filter for imaging the Sun.\n      The in-focus distance for the low resolution diodes was about\n      3.7 meters.\n \n      Diodes in the camera generated a voltage proportional to\n      incoming radiance.  Each diode, except for the SUN diode, had\n      an amplifier to enhance the voltage signal.  The SUN diode did\n      not need an amplifier because of the strong signal when\n      directly viewing the Sun.  Voltage from the amplifier was\n      digitized as a 6-bit number in an A/D converter that also\n      performed automatic dark current subtraction.  Dark current was\n      sampled after every line in slow scan mode and after every 64th\n      line in rapid scan mode.  The A/D converter had 6 gains and 32\n      offsets so that the full dynamic range of the diode output\n      could be stored in 6-bits.  Gain defined the voltage range\n      sampled and its resolution.  Low gain (high gain number)\n      covered a wide range in voltage and had low voltage resolution.\n      The offset could be varied from a slightly negative voltage to\n      several volts in 32 small steps.  Digital values from the A/D\n      converter could be dumped to the spacecraft tape recorder or\n      transmitted to Earth or an orbiter in real-time (usually done\n      at beginning or end of a transmission link when the bit error\n      rate was relatively high).\n \n      Each camera had two pinlights in the post assembly.  Using a\n      special command, the lights turned on and an image was acquired\n      while viewing the pinlights.  This command, known as a scan\n      verification, monitored the mechanical scanning operation of\n      the camera.  A third pinlight with four different radiance\n      levels was located between the dark current shutter and the\n      photosensor array.  This pinlight was used with the shutter\n      closed for radiometric calibration of the camera.\n \n \n    Operation and Sampling Modes\n    ============================\n      Operation of Viking Lander cameras was versatile in that many\n      parameters for the image could be specified.  Commands to\n      acquire an image involved selecting the sampling mode, diode,\n      start and stop azimuths, center elevation, gain and offset,\n      scan rate, and specifying whether automatic dark current\n      subtraction, internal calibration, rescan, or dusting were\n      done.  Image start time and whether the image was transmitted\n      in real-time or sent to the tape recorder were also specified.\n \n      The camera had seven sampling modes: low resolution (0.12 deg)\n      stepping with three diodes (known as triplet mode); low\n      resolution stepping with one diode; high resolution (0.04 deg)\n      stepping with one diode; and four different calibration lamp\n      intensity levels.  In triplet mode, elevation scanning was\n      repeated three times with three different diodes at every\n      azimuth position.  An unusual sampling mode effect was an\n      elevation shift when the step size did not match the diode\n      resolution.  There was a -5.6 deg elevation shift when using a\n      low resolution diode with high resolution stepping and a +5.6\n      deg shift when using a high resolution diode with low\n      resolution stepping.  These non-nominal modes were mostly used\n      to generate high resolution color images or to better resolve\n      the solar disk.  For the triplet mode, the specified diode was\n      the first of the three diodes, e.g., BLUE diode for a color\n      image.  Start and stop azimuths had to be multiples of 2.5 deg.\n      Center elevation had to be a multiple of 10 deg.  The elevation\n      range was determined by the step size with a range of about 20\n      deg for high resolution and about 60 deg for low resolution\n      since there was always 512 steps in an elevation scan.  Rescan\n      was done by inhibiting the azimuth rotation and repeatedly\n      scanning in elevation.  Rescan could be activated by commanding\n      the camera to operate for a time longer then it took to scan\n      the azimuth range of the image.\n \n \n    Principal Investigator\n    ======================\n      The principal investigator for the Viking Lander imaging system\n      during instrument development and the Viking Primary Mission\n      was Thomas A.  Mutch of Brown University.  From the Extended\n      Mission until the end of the Viking Mission, Raymond E.\n      Arvidson of Washington University was the lander imaging\n      principal investigator.","is_prime":true,"tools":[]},{"tags":["Radiation Detector"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lr2.vl2","display_name":"Viking Lander 2 Labeled Release","display_description":"Instrument Overview\n  ===================\n    Each Viking Lander had identical Labeled Release (LR) instruments\n    that used two solid-state beta detectors (Geiger counters) to\n    measure the release of radioactive gas from samples of martian\n    soil that had been inoculated with an aqueous nutrient solution.\n    The instrument contained additional sensors to measure headspace\n    (i.e, the volume of test chamber above the sample) and detector\n    temperatures.  Heaters were also included in the LR instrument\n    for the detectors and test chambers.  A number of published\n    papers describe the characteristics and performance of the LR\n    instrument.  The scientific rationale and early design of the\n    instrument are described in LEVIN1972 and a detailed description\n    of the flight module is given in LEVIN&STRAAT1976A.  A summary of\n    the information from these papers is given here as a high-level\n    description of the LR instrument and its operation.  The Labeled\n    Release instrument was part of a package of three biology\n    experiments on the Viking Landers [KLEIN1974].\n \n \n  Science Objectives\n  ==================\n    The major scientific objectives of the Viking Lander biology\n    investigation were to detect the plausibility and/or presence of\n    life on Mars.  In particular, the LR experiment was designed to\n    detect microbial life in the martian soil.  The Labeled Release\n    experiment tested for heterotrophic metabolism by monitoring the\n    release of radioactive gases from a soil sample inoculated with\n    carbon-14 labeled organic substrates.  The experiment also was\n    designed to analyze control samples that were heat sterilized.\n \n    Several assumptions were used in the design and operation of the\n    Labeled Release experiment.  These assumptions included the\n    following: A) life on Mars was carbon based; B) one or more of\n    the nutrient compounds would be metabolized by possible microbial\n    life; and C) one end product of metabolism would be a carbon\n    based gas.\n \n \n  LR Detailed Description\n  =======================\n    The Labeled Release instrument contained four incubation test\n    cells mounted on a carousel.  Each test cell could be rotated and\n    sealed beneath an assembly that contained a heater, plumbing\n    terminals for nutrient delivery and gas removal, and a tube\n    leading to the beta detectors.  Gas and nutrient moving through\n    the plumbing system were controlled by eight miniaturized\n    solenoid valves.  The headspace was connected to the two\n    solid-state beta detectors through a tube bent at several spots.\n    The connecting tube was bent to prevent radioactive particles\n    from reaching the detectors from the test cell.  The instrument\n    also had two temperature sensors.  One sensor measured the\n    temperature of the detectors and the other measured the\n    temperature of the headspace within the test cell.  For a\n    schematic and photographs of the Labeled Release instrument see\n    LEVIN&STRAAT1976A.\n \n    The Labeled Release nutrient was stored in a sealed glass ampoule\n    within a reservoir.  The reservoir, in turn, was connected to the\n    test cells by the instrument plumbing system.  The ampoule\n    containing the nutrient was broken by a mechanical striker driven\n    by high pressure helium shortly after the spacecraft landed on\n    the surface of Mars.  Low pressure helium was then bubbled\n    through the nutrient in the reservoir for several hours in order\n    to degas the nutrient.  At the start of an analysis cycle high\n    pressure helium was used to route a portion of the nutrient into\n    a sealed test cell.  Testing prior to launch indicated that 0.115\n    cc +/- 8% of nutrient was delivered during each injection.  The\n    pressure in the test cell headspace was kept above Mars ambient\n    atmospheric pressure with helium from the plumbing system to\n    prevent boiling of the nutrient.  The total pressure at the start\n    of an analysis cycle was about 9200 Pa (92 millibar).  At the end\n    of an analysis cycle, radioactive gas was purged from the test\n    cell through the plumbing system.\n \n    The LR instrument had two identical solid-state beta detectors\n    (Geiger counters) to monitor the evolved radioactive gas from the\n    soil sample.  There were two detectors as a contingency against\n    failure of one detector.  The detectors continuously counted\n    gaseous radioactivity as it evolved from the test cell.  The\n    instrument could be commanded to count with either one or both\n    detectors.  Detectors were referred to as the right and left\n    channels.  The Viking Landers were powered by radioisotope\n    thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which provided background\n    radiation to the detectors.  As a result, this background signal\n    had to be determined by monitoring the detectors for one to\n    several Mars days before nutrient was injected into a test cell.\n \n    The test cell heaters were used in a number of ways.  Samples\n    could be heated in the test cell prior to nutrient injections to\n    provide sterilized control samples.  During an analysis cycle the\n    test cell was heated to prevent the temperature from falling\n    below 9-10 degree C during the martian night.  The heater was\n    also used at the end of an analysis cycle to dry the sample.\n \n    The Labeled Release instrument shared common support services\n    with the other biology instruments.  This included the sample\n    delivery system [KLEIN1974].  Martian soil samples were collected\n    by the Viking Lander surface sampler arm [MOOREETAL1987;\n    CROUCH1977].  Soil from the sampler arm was dumped into a hopper\n    on top of the lander.  The hopper contained a sieve that only\n    allowed particles less than 2 mm in size to enter the instrument\n    test cells.  The sieved samples entered a distribution assembly\n    that automatically delivered measured volumes of soil to each\n    biology experiment [KLEIN1974].  The Labeled Release instrument\n    typically received 0.5 cc of soil.\n \n    The Biology common support services and the Labeled Release\n    instrument held enough nutrient and helium to conduct up to two\n    injections on four soil samples.  Testing prior to launch showed\n    that after proper drying of a soil sample and purging of gases\n    from a test cell that the cell could be used a second time by\n    adding more soil and nutrient.  One of the test cells on Viking\n    Lander 2 was used a second time.\n \n \n  Nutrient Description\n  ====================\n    Considerable effort went into selecting, preparing, and testing\n    the nutrients for the Label Release experiment\n    [LEVIN&STRAAT1976A].  Selection criteria were partially based on\n    the assumption that life evolved similarly on Mars as on Earth.\n    There were several criteria used in selecting compounds for the\n    nutrient that included: A) Compounds that were likely to be\n    produced on Mars; B) Compounds that primitive organisms were\n    likely to use in metabolism based on terrestrial analogs; and C)\n    Compounds that were unlikely to have nonbiological reactions with\n    martian soil.  In addition, each compound in the nutrient was\n    tested to show that it produced a rapid response in a variety of\n    terrestrial soils and in cultures of several types of organisms.\n    The stability of the materials was also considered given that the\n    nutrient was stored for about 2 years from the time it was\n    prepared until it was used on Mars.  The storage period included\n    the nearly one year cruise phase of the spacecraft on its journey\n    to Mars.  Nutrient material also had to undergo sterilization of\n    the biology module (54 hr at 120 degree C) and the entire\n    spacecraft (20 hr at 100 degree C).  It was expected that some\n    decomposition (<1%) of the nutrient would occur due to the long\n    storage time and sterilization.  Any radioactive carbon dioxide\n    produced by the nutrient decomposition was removed by flushing\n    the nutrient reservoir with helium before the first injection.  A\n    complete list of nutrient compounds is given in\n    LEVIN&STRAAT1976A.  The nutrient included sodium formate, calcium\n    glycolate, glycine, D- and L-alanine, sodium D-lactate and sodium\n    L-lactate.  The concentrations of each nutrient component were\n    dilute in case any particular compound was toxic to possible\n    martian organisms.  Each compound in the nutrient was labeled\n    with a precise amount of radioactive carbon-14.\n \n \n  Operation and Sampling Modes\n  ============================\n    The basic analysis cycle for the Labeled Release experiment was\n    to have a sample of martian soil delivered to a test cell and to\n    be moistened with an aqueous solution of carbon-14 labeled\n    organic media.  A second nutrient injection was typically done\n    about 7-8 Mars days after the first injection.  The headspace\n    above the sample was monitored continuously for evolved\n    radioactive gas as evidence for metabolism.  Viking Lander 1\n    completed four cycles, whereas Viking Lander 2 completed five\n    cycles for a total of nine cycles between the two landers.  VL2\n    cycle 5 was performed in a previously used test cell using a\n    stored portion of the cycle 4 soil sample.  Eight of the cycles\n    received two injections of nutrient.  VL1 cycle 3 received three\n    injections of nutrient.\n \n    Three of the analysis cycles were control cycles where the soil\n    sample was heated for several hours before nutrient injection.\n    The control cycle for Viking Lander 1 was heated to 160 degree C.\n    After receiving highly attenuated results from Viking Lander 1,\n    Viking Lander 2 control cycles were modified to be 50 degree C.\n \n    Radioactivity was counted for 16-minute intervals during an\n    analysis cycle, except for several hours around the time of\n    nutrient injection where intervals of 2- to 4-minutes were used.\n    Background levels were determined by measuring the test cell for\n    several Mars days prior to nutrient injection.  The headspace and\n    detector temperatures were measured every 16 minutes throughout\n    an analysis cycle.\n \n    At the end of the cycle, the radioactive gas was removed by\n    purging and the soil was dried by brief heating to prevent\n    evaporation upon opening the cell.  A fresh test cell was then\n    rotated beneath the head end assembly and a three-hour cleanup\n    was accomplished by heating both the head assembly and detectors\n    during continuous helium purging.  After cooling, trapped\n    nutrient was vented from the system.\n \n    The instrument was fairly automated with preprogrammed sequences.\n    Commands could be sent from the ground to change the\n    preprogrammed sequences to perform nutrient injections, to select\n    active or control sequences, to select a fresh soil sample, and\n    to initiate or terminate an analysis cycle.  Commands could be\n    sent to conduct single or double channel counting.\n \n \n  Principal Investigator\n  ======================\n    The principal investigator for the Viking Lander Labeled Release\n    experiment was Dr.  Gilbert V.  Levin of Biospherics, Inc.

The remainder of the 'instrument' was\n      located at ground stations of the NASA Deep Space Network\n      (DSN).  Much of the equipment at both ends was shared, being\n      used for routine telecommunications as well as for Radio\n      Science.  Radio data were themselves shared; Doppler and range\n      measurements were used to calculate the spacecraft trajectory\n      and to search for gravity waves.  Measurements of signal\n      parameters after waves had propagated through the\n      interplanetary medium were used to infer properties of the\n      medium, characterize small perturbations in spacecraft\n      attitude, and search for gravity waves.\n \n      Data included in this archive data set are from routine\n      tracking and special tests conducted while Mars Observer was in\n      its Cruise Phase between Earth and Mars.  Cruise operations\n      were used to improve operator proficiency in carrying out\n      activities related to radio science observations and to measure\n      the performance of various parts of the radio science and\n      ground data systems.\n \n \n    Instrument Overview - Spacecraft\n    ================================\n      Spacecraft Radio System: The spacecraft radio system was\n      constructed around a redundant pair of Mars Observer\n      Transponders (MOTs) which received at 7.2 GHz and transmitted\n      at 8.4 GHz, both of which are called 'X-band' frequencies.  The\n      exact transmitted frequency was controlled by the signal\n      received from a ground station or by an on-board oscillator.\n      The transponders provided the usual uplink command and downlink\n      data transmission capabilities.  The MOT also included a\n      ranging 'channel' which could be driven either by signals from\n      the ground for measurement of absolute range or by tones\n      generated on-board to enable measurement of differential range\n      between two ground stations.\n \n      An MOT generated a downlink signal in either a 'coherent' or a\n      'non-coherent' mode, also known as the 'two-way' and 'one-way'\n      modes, respectively.  When operating in the coherent mode, the\n      MOT behaved as a conventional transponder, its transmitted\n      carrier frequency being derived from the received uplink\n      carrier frequency with a 'turn-around ratio' of 880/749.  In\n      the non-coherent mode, the downlink carrier frequency was\n      derived from one of the spacecraft's on-board oscillators.\n \n      One of the on-board oscillators, the 'ultra-stable oscillator'\n      (USO), had been specially provided to serve as a precision\n      frequency reference for radio occultation experiments.  Built\n      by the Applied Physics Laboratory of John Hopkins University,\n      the USO was positioned within the spacecraft so as to minimize\n      its exposure to thermal variations and mechanical vibration.\n      The USO consisted of a quartz crystal resonator contained in a\n      temperature-controlled titanium dewar.  Its output frequency\n      was near 19.14 MHz.  The X-band carrier for non-coherent\n      downlink transmission was produced by multiplying the USO\n      output frequency by 440.  The Mars Observer USO was from a\n      newer generation than those flown on the Voyager and Galileo\n      spacecraft.  Its frequency stability, as characterized by the\n      Allan deviation and after accounting for linear drift, was\n      measured to be better than 2E-13 for integration times in the\n      range one to several hundred seconds.  This represents more\n      than an order of magnitude improvement in performance over the\n      Voyager and Galileo devices.  After a 25 day warm-up period,\n      the USO was expected to have a daily aging rate of 6E-11 and a\n      long term frequency change after five years of significantly\n      less than 1E-6.  Laboratory measurements also showed\n      state-of-the-art phase noise and spectral purity as well as\n      amplitude stability performance for a device of this type.\n      During Cruise, the USO drifted 0.2 Hz/day at its X-band output\n      frequency; Allan Deviation for the end-to-end non-coherent\n      system was consistent with the 2E-13 measurements before\n      launch.\n \n      Each MOT also contained a separate, 'auxiliary' oscillator\n      which could be used to generate the non-coherent downlink\n      carrier.  However, the frequency stability of the auxiliary\n      oscillators was about six to seven orders of magnitude poorer\n      than the USO.  They were, therefore, not applicable to these\n      radio science investigations.\n \n      The strength of a spacecraft carrier signal, and thus the\n      quality of the radio occultation data, depends on its\n      modulation state.  Mars Observer telemetry data were Manchester\n      encoded and then used to modulate a 1 MHz square wave\n      subcarrier which, in turn, modulated the X-band carrier.\n      Telemetry modulation typically resulted in carrier suppression\n      of either 15.2 dB (simultaneous transmission of science and\n      engineering telemetry) or 9.3 dB (engineering telemetry only).\n      The two-way ranging channel, when activated, suppressed the\n      carrier by about 0.2 dB; the differential range modulation\n      reduced the carrier by another 0.2 dB when in use.  Each\n      modulation type -- telemetry, range, and differential range\n      modulation -- could be switched on or off independently.\n \n      Traveling wave tube amplifiers, driven at saturation, amplified\n      the MOT output before the signals were radiated via (nominally)\n      a steerable 1.5 m diameter parabolic high gain antenna (HGA).\n      Effective isotropic radiated power was about 83 dBm.  In\n      contrast to past practice for planetary missions, the HGA was\n      mounted at the end of a 5.6 meter boom so that the phase center\n      of the antenna was about 6 meters from the spacecraft center of\n      mass.\n \n      Pertinent details of the subsystem are shown below:\n \n      Instrument Id                  : RSS\n      Instrument Host Id             : MO\n      Pi Pds User Id                 : LTYLER\n      Instrument Name                : RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM\n      Instrument Type                : RADIO SCIENCE\n      Build Date                     : N/A\n      Instrument Mass                : N/A\n      Instrument Length              : N/A\n      Instrument Width               : N/A\n      Instrument Height              : N/A\n      Instrument Manufacturer Name   : MOTOROLA\n \n \n      Principal Investigator\n      ----------------------\n        The Team Leader for the Radio Science Team was G.  Leonard\n        Tyler of Stanford University.\n \n \n    Scientific Objectives\n    =====================\n      Two different types of radio science experiments were to be\n      conducted with Mars Observer: radio tracking experiments in\n      which the magnitude and direction of the planet's gravity field\n      were derived from the Doppler and ranging measurements, and\n      radio propagation experiments in which modulation on the signal\n      received on Earth could be attributed to properties of an\n      occulting medium, such as the atmosphere of Mars.\n \n \n      Gravity Measurements\n      --------------------\n        Measurement of the gravity field provides significant\n        constraints on inferences about interior structure of Mars.\n        Precise, detailed study of the spacecraft motion in Mars\n        orbit would have yielded the mass distribution of the planet.\n        Topographic data obtained by the Mars Observer Laser\n        Altimeter (MOLA) would have formed a critical adjunct to the\n        measurements of the gravity field since only after the\n        gravitational effects are adjusted for topography can the\n        gravity anomalies be interpreted geophysically.  For example,\n        our present understanding of the geometrical flattening is\n        sufficiently uncertain that discussions as to whether or not\n        Mars is in hydrostatic equilibrium cannot be conclusive until\n        altimeter data are available; similarly, the large\n        uncertainty in the precession constant precludes knowledge of\n        individual moments of inertia.  Values for these basic\n        quantities derived from Mars Observer would have been useful\n        in studies of Mars' internal stress, radial density, and\n        internal temperature.\n \n        Studies of the gravity field would have emphasized both the\n        global field and local characteristics of the field.  The\n        first task was to determine the global field.  Doppler and\n        range tracking measurements spanning periods of several days\n        would have yielded accurate spacecraft trajectory solutions.\n        Simultaneously with reconstruction of the spacecraft orbit,\n        observation equations for approximately 2500 field\n        coefficients and a small number of ancillary parameters would\n        have been derived.  This type of gravity field solution is\n        essential for characterizing tectonic phenomena such as the\n        Tharsis bulge and can also be used to study localized\n        features.  Results were expected to be available some months\n        after the data were collected, although the final global\n        gravity field would not have been available for one or two\n        years after the end of the Mission.\n \n        'Short-arc,' line-of-sight Doppler tracking measurements\n        obtained when the Earth-to-spacecraft line-of-sight was\n        within a few degrees of the orbit plane were expected to\n        provide the highest resolution of local features.  The\n        results from this type of observation typically are presented\n        as contoured acceleration profiles of specific features\n        (e.g., craters, volcanoes, etc.) or line-of-sight\n        acceleration maps of specific regions.  The high spatial\n        resolution of these products makes them especially useful to\n        geophysicists for study of features in the size range of 300\n        to 1,000 km.  Because of the relative simplicity of the data\n        analysis, results can be available within a few weeks after\n        the data are collected.\n \n \n      Radio Occultation Measurements\n      ------------------------------\n        Atmospheric measurements by the method of radio occultation\n        were expected to contribute to an improved understanding of\n        the circulation, dynamics, and the transport of volatiles and\n        dust in the atmosphere of Mars.  These results would have\n        been based on detailed analysis of the radio signal received\n        from Mars Observer as it entered and exited occultation by\n        the planet.  Two coordinated investigations of the atmosphere\n        were planned within the Radio Science Team.  The first was to\n        focus on obtaining vertical profiles of atmospheric structure\n        with emphasis on investigation of large-scale phenomena,\n        while the second was to concentrate on studies of the\n        small-scale atmospheric structure that causes scintillations\n        in the radio signal.\n \n        Retrieval of atmospheric profiles requires coherent samples\n        of the radio signal that has propagated through Mars'\n        atmosphere, plus accurate knowledge of the spacecraft\n        trajectory.  The latter was to be obtained first from the\n        Mars Observer Navigation Team and later, internally, from\n        Radio Science Team gravity investigators.  Initial solutions\n        were expected to provide atmospheric structure -- temperature\n        and pressure vs.  absolute radius -- to altitudes of at least\n        50 km with about 240 m vertical resolution; these 'standard'\n        profiles were expected within 2-4 weeks of data acquisition.\n        After correction for diffractive propagation effects,\n        vertical resolutions of 10-20 m might have been obtained.\n        These 'high-resolution' profiles require an increase in the\n        complexity of retrieval algorithms, which were being revised\n        when the spacecraft was lost.  Measures of total columnar\n        content, surface pressure, planet radius at the occultation\n        point, and properties of the ionosphere, if detectable, would\n        have been obtained for each occultation.\n \n        The spatial and temporal coverage in the radio occultation\n        experiments would have been determined by the geometry of the\n        spacecraft orbit.  In the mapping phase of the mission, the\n        Mars Observer spacecraft was to circle Mars in a\n        low-altitude, sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit with a period\n        of about 117 min.  As most orbits of the spacecraft included\n        an occultation by Mars, this trajectory provided frequent\n        opportunities for radio occultation measurements of the\n        neutral atmosphere and ionosphere.  The occultations\n        generally occurred at high latitudes in both hemispheres.\n        The rotation of the planet between successive orbits would\n        have allowed systematic measurements at regular intervals of\n        about 29 degrees in longitude.  Although most occultations\n        were expected to be in polar regions, the view from Earth of\n        the sun-synchronous spacecraft orbit would have evolved\n        slowly in response to the orbital motions of Earth and Mars\n        about the Sun, yielding opportunities for occultation\n        measurements at a variety of latitudes and local times over\n        the course of the 687-day mission.\n \n \n    Operational Considerations\n    ==========================\n      Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The\n      spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units, each\n      with slightly different characteristics.  As transponder units\n      age, their performance changes slightly.  More importantly, the\n      performance for Radio Science depended on operational factors\n      such as the modulation state for the transmitters, which cannot\n      be predicted in advance.  The performance also depended on\n      factors which were not always under the control of the Mars\n      Observer Project.\n \n      During radio occultation periods, telemetry modulation would\n      have been turned off; during many of the tests included in the\n      Cruise data set telemetry was also suspended.  No special\n      modulation requirements were required during routine tracking\n      for trajectory determination.\n \n      The steerable 1.5 m diameter parabolic high gain antenna (HGA)\n      was mounted at the end of a 5.6 meter boom so that the phase\n      center of the antenna was about 6 meters from the spacecraft\n      center of mass.  An area of concern to the Mars Observer Radio\n      Science and Navigation Teams was the set of 'pseudo-Doppler'\n      effects introduced into the radio tracking and occultation data\n      by motion of the HGA relative to the spacecraft center of mass;\n      it would have been necessary to remove these during data\n      reduction before deriving the gravity field or occultation\n      profiles.  Six sources of HGA motion were identified: (i) the\n      spacecraft rotation needed to maintain nadir pointing while in\n      orbit, (ii) articulation of the HGA to maintain Earth point,\n      (iii) HGA boom flexure, (iv) short term migration of the\n      spacecraft center of mass associated with effects such as\n      'sloshing' of propellants and motions of articulating booms,\n      (v) spacecraft attitude instability, and (vi) spacecraft\n      response to cycling of momentum wheels.  The first two error\n      sources are deterministic to the extent that their effects can\n      be taken into account accurately with rather straightforward\n      modeling.  Boom flexure was believed to be insignificant.\n      Other motions of the spacecraft center of mass were studied;\n      there were reasons to believe that they would not have proven\n      to be major problems.\n \n      Item (v) remained a concern at the time the spacecraft was\n      lost.  When first analyzed in 1987, tracking error from this\n      source alone was calculated to be nearly an order-of-magnitude\n      greater than that from the next largest source.  For the normal\n      'mapping' configuration, nadir pointing of the spacecraft would\n      have been controlled by referencing spacecraft attitude to the\n      Mars 'horizon' as defined by carbon dioxide emissions from the\n      atmosphere.  Atmospheric disturbances can affect determination\n      of the horizon, however, causing the spacecraft attitude to\n      deviate from the true nadir orientation.  Doppler error from\n      HGA motion, then, can be coupled to atmospheric features, some\n      of which are stable and associated with surface features (e.g.,\n      the semi-permanent waves associated with the Tharsis volcanoes,\n      and the winter polar hood).  This coupling would have made such\n      signatures difficult or impossible to distinguish in the data\n      from Doppler effects caused by the spacecraft response to\n      gravity features.  After the 1987 analysis, attitude control\n      design engineers at the spacecraft contractor (General\n      Electric, AstroSpace Division) and at the Jet Propulsion\n      Laboratory (JPL) implemented new control algorithms to reduce\n      spacecraft attitude response to local atmospheric features.  By\n      mid-1993, analytically predicted Doppler effects resulting from\n      HGA motion relative to the spacecraft center of mass no longer\n      represented the dominant error source for gravity field or\n      atmospheric occultation measurements.  Predicted errors\n      associated with the attitude control system remained\n      significant, however, and study of this question was\n      continuing.\n \n      Item (vi) was identified as a potential source of error only\n      after launch of Mars Observer.  Normal rotation of the\n      spacecraft resulted in transfer of angular momentum among the\n      on board momentum wheels.  At regular intervals, spaced by 90\n      degrees of rotation, one set of wheels or another would pass\n      through zero angular momentum and physically stop.  Static\n      friction prevented smooth resumption of wheel rotation as the\n      spacecraft continued turning; an attitude transient resulted,\n      which could last for several minutes.  Modeling of these\n      'sticksion' events based on reconstruction of attitude allowed\n      most Doppler effects to be removed from non-coherent Cruise\n      data.  But signal-to-noise ratios would have been considerably\n      higher during Mapping, and the accuracy to which this could\n      have been carried out under the best radio science observing\n      conditions remained a concern.\n \n \n    Calibration\n    ===========\n      No information is available on calibration of the radio system.\n \n \n    Operational Modes\n    =================\n      The Mars Observer telecommunications system could be viewed as\n      having two sections, which could be operated in the following\n      modes:\n \n \n      Section      Mode\n      -------------------------------------------\n      Oscillator   two-way (coherent)\n                   one-way (non-coherent)\n      RF output    low-gain antenna\n                   high-gain antenna\n \n      Selected parameters describing transponder performance are\n      listed below:\n \n      Oscillator Parameters:                      X-Band\n         Two-Way Transponder Turnaround Ratio     880/749\n         One-Way Transmit Frequency (MHz)         8423.200\n \n      RF Output parameters:                       X-Band\n         Power at HGA output                      46.5 dBm\n         High-Gain Antenna:\n           Gain (dBi)                             39.95\n           Polarization                           Right Circular\n \n \n \n    Instrument Overview - DSN\n    =========================\n      Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near\n      Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise\n      the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with\n      several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High\n      Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m standard (STD)], associated\n      electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity at each\n      complex is radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry\n      data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is\n      possible in several radio-frequency bands, the most common\n      being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a\n      wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-\n      3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kw are\n      available.\n \n      Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded\n      waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis\n      of the received coding allows navigators to determine the\n      distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the\n      carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight\n      spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used\n      to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity\n      fields of objects near the spacecraft.\n \n      Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have\n      propagated through or been scattered from target media.\n      Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with\n      surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer\n      physical and electrical properties of the target.\n \n      Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.\n      See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument\n      description or the data set description for specifics.\n \n      The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion\n      Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the\n      U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n      Specifications include:\n \n      Instrument Id                  : RSS\n      Instrument Host Id             : DSN\n      Pi Pds User Id                 : LTYLER\n      Instrument Name                : RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM\n      Instrument Type                : RADIO SCIENCE\n      Build Date                     : N/A\n      Instrument Mass                : N/A\n      Instrument Length              : N/A\n      Instrument Width               : N/A\n      Instrument Height              : N/A\n      Instrument Manufacturer Name   : N/A\n \n \n      For more information on the Deep Space Network and its use in\n      radio science investigations see the reports by\n      [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993] and [ASMAR&HERRERA1993].

Their system performance directly determines the\n      degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their\n      system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the\n      results of the experiments.  The following paragraphs describe\n      the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.\n      This material has been adapted from [ASMAR&HERRERA1993]; for\n      additional information, consult [DSN810-5].\n \n      Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing\n      Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion\n      Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated\n      below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried\n      over from earlier times when antennas were individually\n      instrumented) are listed in the table.\n \n \n          --------   --------   --------   --------   --------\n         | DSS 12 | | DSS 18 | | DSS 14 | | DSS 15 | | DSS 16 |\n         |34-m STD| |34-m STD| |  70-m  | |34-m HEF| |  26-m  |\n          --------   --------   --------   --------   --------\n              |            |     |             |          |\n              |            v     v             |          v\n              |           ---------            |     ---------\n               --------->|GOLDSTONE|<----------     |EARTH/ORB|\n                         | SPC  10 |<-------------->|   LINK  |\n                          ---------                  ---------\n                         |   SPC   |<-------------->|   26-M  |\n                         |  COMM   |         ------>|   COMM  |\n                          ---------         |        ---------\n                              |             |            |\n                              v             |            v\n             ------       ---------         |        ---------\n            | NOCC |<--->|   JPL   |<-------        |         |\n             ------      | CENTRAL |                |   GSFC  |\n             ------      |   COMM  |                | NASCOMM |\n            | MCCC |<--->| TERMINAL|<-------------->|         |\n             ------       ---------                  ---------\n                                                      ^     ^\n                                                      |     |\n                   CANBERRA (SPC 40) <----------------      |\n                                                            |\n                     MADRID (SPC 60) <----------------------\n \n                          GOLDSTONE     CANBERRA      MADRID\n             Antenna        SPC 10       SPC 40       SPC 60\n            --------      ---------     --------     --------\n            26-m            DSS 16       DSS 46       DSS 66\n            34-m STD        DSS 12       DSS 42       DSS 61\n                            DSS 18       DSS 48       DSS 68\n            34-m HEF        DSS 15       DSS 45       DSS 65\n            70-m            DSS 14       DSS 43       DSS 63\n            Developmental   DSS 13\n \n \n      Subsystem interconnections at each DSCC are shown in the\n      diagram below, and they are described in the sections that\n      follow.

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The\n        DMC receives and archives most of the information from the\n        NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their\n        operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well\n        as the handling and displaying of any responses to control\n        directives and configuration and status information received\n        from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The\n        effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and\n        archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.\n        Communication between the various subsystems is done using a\n        Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a\n        network interface unit (NIU).\n \n        DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the\n        Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and\n        Control (LMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for\n        Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict\n        sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna\n        pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and\n        then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate\n        subsystems via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in\n        the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.\n        The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm\n        messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels\n        for the DSP.  Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is\n        done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform\n        some of the functions performed by the LMC.  There are two\n        CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC\n        The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if\n        necessary.\n \n        The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor\n        and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to\n        support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might\n        include the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) (which,\n        in turn, can control the SSI), or the Tracking Subsystem.\n        The LMC also maintains an operator log which includes\n        operator directives and subsystem responses.  One important\n        Radio Science specific function that the LMC performs is\n        receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal\n        level data from the PPM for display at the LMC console and\n        for inclusion in Monitor blocks.  These blocks are recorded\n        on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the Mission Control\n        and Computing Center (MCCC) displays.  The LMC is required to\n        operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio\n        Science data acquisition period.\n \n        The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital\n        Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication\n        between the stations and JPL.  The ARA receives all required\n        data and status messages from the LMC/CMC and can record them\n        to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The\n        ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL and passes\n        them on to the CMC.\n \n \n      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem\n      ---------------------------------\n        Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from\n        the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m STD antenna subnets.  The\n        antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors\n        which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio\n        frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large\n        collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy\n        onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and\n        angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for\n        gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between\n        zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as 5\n        cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling of\n        energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector and\n        then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas have\n        'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms that\n        are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows more\n        uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The 34-m\n        STD primary reflectors are classical paraboloids, while the\n        subreflectors are standard hyperboloids.\n \n        On the 70-m and 34-m STD antennas, the subreflector directs\n        received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a\n        device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn\n        and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In\n        the 34-m HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which\n        accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.\n        RF energy to be transmitted into space by the horns is\n        focused by the reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams,\n        pointed with high precision (either to the dichroic plate or\n        directly to the subreflector) by a series of drive motors and\n        gear trains that can rotate the movable components and their\n        support structures.\n \n        The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two\n        pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are\n        CONSCAN and 'blind pointing.' With CONSCAN enabled and a\n        closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the\n        system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around\n        its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are\n        computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied\n        by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly\n        (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the\n        Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern\n        to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the\n        receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal\n        level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan\n        position with the received signal level variations allows the\n        APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.\n        Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control\n        system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent\n        direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional\n        function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and\n        residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and\n        predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly\n        (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL\n        via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna\n        status monitoring.\n \n        During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low\n        received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an\n        occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under\n        these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and\n        pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined\n        Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.\n \n        Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least\n        the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received\n        Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain\n        experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may\n        be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on\n        elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal\n        degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs\n        (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)\n        which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC\n        passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to\n        the desired position.  Unlike the 70-m and 34-m HEFs which\n        have azimuth-elevation (AZ-EL) drives, the 34-m STD antennas\n        use (hour angle-declination) HA-DEC drives.  The same\n        positioning of the subreflector on the 34-m STD does not\n        create the same effect as on the 70-m and 34-m HEFs.\n \n        Pointing angles for all three antenna types are computed by\n        the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by\n        the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived\n        by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the\n        APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts\n        into AZ-EL coordinates for the 70-m and 34-m HEFs or into\n        HA-DEC coordinates for the 34-m STD antennas.  The LMC\n        operator then downloads the antenna AZ-EL or HA-DEC predict\n        points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer along with a\n        selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts consist of\n        time-tagged AZ-EL or HA-DEC points at selected time intervals\n        along with polynomial coefficients for interpolation between\n        points.\n \n        The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,\n        corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and\n        subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error\n        correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS\n        then sends angular position commands for each axis at the\n        rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate\n        commands are generated from the position commands at the\n        servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the\n        antenna.  In the 34-m STD antennas motors, rather than\n        servos, are used to steer the antenna; there is no feedback\n        once the 34-m STD has been told where to point.\n \n        When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for\n        spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using\n        'planetary mode' -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension\n        (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly\n        with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to\n        the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS\n        quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points\n        which are on one-day centers.\n \n        A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for\n        tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial\n        frame.\n \n        Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna\n        has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called\n        'precision' mode.  A pointing control loop derives the main\n        AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two- axis\n        autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference\n        Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a\n        precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive\n        system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main\n        antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft\n        encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-\n        elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by\n        measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light\n        beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by\n        moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.\n        Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are\n        possible in 'precision' mode.  The 'precision' mode is not\n        available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their\n        beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.\n \n \n      DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem\n      --------------------------------\n        70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones\n        installed in a structure at the center of the main reflector.\n        The feeds are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.\n        Selection of the feed is made by rotation of the\n        subreflector.  A dichroic mirror assembly, half on the S-band\n        cone and half on the X-band cone, permits simultaneous use of\n        the S- and X-band frequencies.  The third cone is devoted to\n        R&D and more specialized work.\n \n        The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-\n        and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them\n        through polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The\n        polarizer plates are adjusted so that the signals are\n        directed to a pair of redundant amplifiers for each\n        frequency, thus allowing simultaneous reception of signals in\n        two orthogonal polarizations.  For S-band these are two Block\n        IVA S-band Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the\n        amplifiers are Block IIA TWMs.\n \n        34-m STD Antennas: These antennas have two feed horns, one\n        for S-band signals and one for X-band.  The horns are mounted\n        on a cone which is fixed in relation to the subreflector.  A\n        dichroic plate mounted above the horns directs energy from\n        the subreflector into the proper horn.\n \n        The AMS directs the received S- and X-band signals through\n        polarizer plates and on to amplification.  There are two\n        Block III S-band TWMs and two Block I X-band TWMs.\n \n        34-m HEF Antennas: Unlike the other antennas, the 34-m HEF\n        uses a single feed for both S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S-\n        and X-band receive as well as X-band transmit is possible\n        thanks to the presence of an S/X 'combiner' which acts as a\n        diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP is user selected through a\n        switch so neither a polarizer nor an orthomode transducer is\n        needed.  X-band amplification options include two Block II\n        TWMs or an HEMT Low Noise Amplifier (LNA).  S-band\n        amplification is provided by an FET LNA.\n \n \n      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem\n      -------------------------------\n        The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of three groups of\n        equipment: the closed-loop receiver group, the open-loop\n        receiver group, and the RF monitor group.  This subsystem is\n        controlled by the Receiver-Exciter Controller (REC) which\n        communicates directly with the DMC for predicts and OCI\n        reception and status reporting.\n \n        The exciter generates the S-band signal (or X-band for the\n        34-m HEF only) which is provided to the Transmitter Subsystem\n        for the spacecraft uplink signal.  It is tunable under\n        command of the Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO) which\n        receives predicts from the Metric Data Assembly (MDA).\n \n        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and\n        the feed horn for all three antennas (used for simultaneous\n        transmission and reception) may be configured such that it is\n        out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass\n        mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the\n        receiver system.\n \n        Closed Loop Receivers: The Block IV receiver-exciter at the\n        70-m stations allows for two receiver channels, each capable\n        of L-Band (e.g., 1668 MHz frequency or 18 cm wavelength),\n        S-band, or X-band reception, and an S-band exciter for\n        generation of uplink signals through the low-power or\n        high-power transmitter.  The Block III receiver-exciter at\n        the 34-m STD stations allows for two receiver channels, each\n        capable of S-band or X-band reception and an exciter used to\n        generate an uplink signal through the low-power transmitter.\n        The receiver-exciter at the 34-m HEF stations allows for one\n        channel only.\n \n        The closed-loop receivers provide the capability for rapid\n        acquisition of a spacecraft signal and telemetry lockup.  In\n        order to accomplish acquisition within a short time, the\n        receivers are predict driven to search for, acquire, and\n        track the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition\n        precludes manual tuning though that remains as a backup\n        capability.  The subsystem utilizes FFT analyzers for rapid\n        acquisition.  The predicts are NSS generated, transmitted to\n        the CMC which sends them to the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem\n        where two sets can be stored.  The receiver starts\n        acquisition at uplink time plus one round-trip-light-time or\n        at operator specified times.  The receivers may also be\n        operated from the LMC without a local operator attending\n        them.  The receivers send performance and status data,\n        displays, and event messages to the LMC.\n \n        Either the exciter synthesizer signal or the simulation (SIM)\n        synthesizer signal is used as the reference for the Doppler\n        extractor in the closed-loop receiver systems, depending on\n        the spacecraft being tracked (and Project guidelines).  The\n        SIM synthesizer is not ramped; instead it uses one constant\n        frequency, the Track Synthesizer Frequency (TSF), which is an\n        average frequency for the entire pass.\n \n        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of\n        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It will be\n        configured such that the expected amplitude changes are\n        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth\n        (2BLo) will be configured such that the expected phase\n        changes can be accommodated while maintaining the best\n        possible loop SNR.\n \n        Open-Loop Receivers: The Radio Science Open-Loop Receiver\n        (OLR) is a dedicated four channel, narrow-band receiver which\n        provides amplified and downconverted video band signals to\n        the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP).\n \n        The OLR utilizes a fixed first Local Oscillator (LO)\n        frequency and a tunable second LO frequency to minimize phase\n        noise and improve frequency stability.  The OLR consists of\n        an RF-to-IF downconverter located in the antenna, an IF\n        selection switch (IVC), and a Radio Science IF-VF\n        downconverter (RIV) located in the SPC.  The RF-IF\n        downconverters in the 70-m antennas are equipped for four IF\n        channels: S-RCP, S-LCP, X-RCP, and X-LCP.  The 34-m HEF\n        stations are equipped with a two-channel RF-IF: S-band and\n        X-band.  The IVC switches the IF input between the 70-m and\n        34-m HEF antennas.\n \n        The RIV contains the tunable second LO, a set of video\n        bandpass filters, IF attenuators, and a controller (RIC).\n        The LO tuning is done via DSP control of the POCA/PLO\n        combination based on a predict set.  The POCA is a\n        Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly and the PLO is a\n        Programmable Local Oscillator (commonly called the DANA\n        synthesizer).  The bandpass filters are selectable via the\n        DSP.  The RIC provides an interface between the DSP and the\n        RIV.  It is controlled from the LMC via the DSP.  The RIC\n        selects the filter and attenuator settings and provides\n        monitor data to the DSP.  The RIC could also be manually\n        controlled from the front panel in case the electronic\n        interface to the DSP is lost.\n \n        RF Monitor -- SSI and PPM: The RF monitor group of the\n        Receiver-Exciter Subsystem provides spectral measurements\n        using the Spectral Signal Indicator (SSI) and measurements of\n        the received channel system temperature and spacecraft signal\n        level using the Precision Power Monitor (PPM).\n \n        The SSI provides a local display of the received signal\n        spectrum at a dedicated terminal at the DSCC and routes these\n        same data to the DSP which routes them to NOCC for remote\n        display at JPL for real-time monitoring and RIV/DSP\n        configuration verification.  These displays are used to\n        validate Radio Science Subsystem data at the DSS, NOCC, and\n        Mission Support Areas.  The SSI configuration is controlled\n        by the DSP and a duplicate of the SSI spectrum appears on the\n        LMC via the DSP.  During real-time operations the SSI data\n        also serve as a quick-look science data type for Radio\n        Science experiments.\n \n        The PPM measures system noise temperatures (SNT) using a\n        Noise Adding Radiometer (NAR) and downlink signal levels\n        using the Signal Level Estimator (SLE).  The PPM accepts its\n        input from the closed-loop receiver.  The SNT is measured by\n        injecting known amounts of noise power into the signal path\n        and comparing the total power with the noise injection 'on'\n        against the total power with the noise injection 'off.' That\n        operation is based on the fact that receiver noise power is\n        directly proportional to temperature; thus measuring the\n        relative increase in noise power due to the presence of a\n        calibrated thermal noise source allows direct calculation of\n        SNT.  Signal level is measured by calculating an FFT to\n        estimate the SNR between the signal level and the receiver\n        noise floor where the power is known from the SNT\n        measurements.\n \n        There is one PPM controller at the SPC which is used to\n        control all SNT measurements.  The SNT integration time can\n        be selected to represent the time required for a measurement\n        of 30K to have a one-sigma uncertainty of 0.3K or 1%.\n \n \n      DSCC Transmitter Subsystem\n      --------------------------\n        The Transmitter Subsystem accepts the S-band frequency\n        exciter signal from the Block III or Block IV Receiver-\n        Exciter Subsystem exciter and amplifies it to the required\n        transmit output level.  The amplified signal is routed via\n        the diplexer through the feed horn to the antenna and then\n        focused and beamed to the spacecraft.\n \n        The Transmitter Subsystem power capabilities range from 18 kw\n        to 400 kw.  Power levels above 18 kw are available only at\n        70-m stations.\n \n \n      DSCC Tracking Subsystem\n      -----------------------\n        The Tracking Subsystem primary functions are to acquire and\n        maintain communications with the spacecraft and to generate\n        and format radiometric data containing Doppler and range.\n \n        The DSCC Tracking Subsystem (DTK) receives the carrier\n        signals and ranging spectra from the Receiver-Exciter\n        Subsystem.  The Doppler cycle counts are counted, formatted,\n        and transmitted to JPL in real time.  Ranging data are also\n        transmitted to JPL in real time.  Also contained in these\n        blocks is the AGC information from the Receiver-Exciter\n        Subsystem.  The Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT)\n        at JPL produces an Archival Tracking Data File (ATDF) tape\n        which contains Doppler and ranging data.\n \n        In addition, the Tracking Subsystem receives from the CMC\n        frequency predicts (used to compute frequency residuals and\n        noise estimates), receiver tuning predicts (used to tune the\n        closed-loop receivers), and uplink tuning predicts (used to\n        tune the exciter).  From the LMC, it receives configuration\n        and control directives as well as configuration and status\n        information on the transmitter, microwave, and frequency and\n        timing subsystems.\n \n        The Metric Data Assembly (MDA) controls all of the DTK\n        functions supporting the uplink and downlink activities.  The\n        MDA receives uplink predicts and controls the uplink tuning\n        by commanding the DCO.  The MDA also controls the Sequential\n        Ranging Assembly (SRA).  It formats the Doppler and range\n        measurements and provides them to the GCF for transmission to\n        NOCC.\n \n        The Sequential Ranging Assembly (SRA) measures the round trip\n        light time (RTLT) of a radio signal traveling from a ground\n        tracking station to a spacecraft and back.  From the RTLT,\n        phase, and Doppler data, the spacecraft range can be\n        determined.  A coded signal is modulated on an uplink carrier\n        and transmitted to the spacecraft where it is detected and\n        transponded back to the ground station.  As a result, the\n        signal received at the tracking station is delayed by its\n        round trip through space and shifted in frequency by the\n        Doppler effect due to the relative motion between the\n        spacecraft and the tracking station on Earth.\n \n \n      DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)\n      ----------------------------------------\n        The DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) located at the\n        SPC digitizes and records on magnetic tapes the narrowband\n        output data from the RIV.  It consists of a Narrow Band\n        Occultation Converter (NBOC) containing four Analog-to-\n        Digital Converters (ADCs), a ModComp CLASSIC computer\n        processor called the Spectrum Processing Assembly (SPA), and\n        two to six magnetic tape drives.  Magnetic tapes are known as\n        Original Data Records (ODRs).  Electronic near real-time\n        transmission of data to JPL (an Original Data Stream, or ODS)\n        may be possible in certain circumstances;\n \n        The DSP is operated through the LMC.  Using the SPA-R\n        software, the DSP allows for real-time frequency and time\n        offsets (while in RUN mode) and, if necessary, snap tuning\n        between the two frequency ranges transmitted by the\n        spacecraft: coherent and non-coherent.  The DSP receives\n        Radio Science frequency predicts from the CMC, allows for\n        multiple predict set archiving (up to 60 sets) at the SPA,\n        and allows for manual predict generation and editing.  It\n        accepts configuration and control data from the LMC, provides\n        display data to the LMC, and transmits the signal spectra\n        from the SSI as well as status information to NOCC and the\n        Project Mission Support Area (MSA) via the GCF data lines.\n        The DSP records the digitized narrowband samples and the\n        supporting header information (i.e., time tags, POCA\n        frequencies, etc.) on 9-track magnetic tapes in 6250 or 1600\n        bpi GCR format.\n \n        Through the DSP-RIC interface the DSP controls the RIV filter\n        selection and attenuation levels.  It also receives RIV\n        performance monitoring via the RIC.  In case of failure of\n        the DSP-RIC interface, the RIV can be controlled manually\n        from the front panel.\n \n        All the RIV and DSP control parameters and configuration\n        directives are stored in the SPA in a macro-like file called\n        an 'experiment directive' table.  A number of default\n        directives exist in the DSP for the major Radio Science\n        experiments.  Operators can create their own table entries.\n \n        Items such as verification of the configuration of the prime\n        open-loop recording subsystem, the selection of the required\n        predict sets, and proper system performance prior to the\n        recording periods will be checked in real-time at JPL via the\n        NOCC displays using primarily the remote SSI display at NOCC\n        and the NRV displays.  Because of this, transmission of the\n        DSP/SSI monitor information is enabled prior to the start of\n        recording.  The specific run time and tape recording times\n        will be identified in the Sequence of Events (SOE) and/or DSN\n        Keyword File.\n \n        The DSP can be used to duplicate ODRs.  It also has the\n        capability to play back a certain section of the recorded\n        data after conclusion of the recording periods.\n \n \n      DSCC Frequency and Timing Subsystem\n      -----------------------------------\n        The Frequency and Timing Subsystem (FTS) provides all\n        frequency and timing references required by the other DSCC\n        subsystems.  It contains four frequency standards of which\n        one is prime and the other three are backups.  Selection of\n        the prime standard is done via the CMC.  Of these four\n        standards, two are hydrogen masers followed by clean-up loops\n        (CUL) and two are cesium standards.  These four standards all\n        feed the Coherent Reference Generator (CRG) which provides\n        the frequency references used by the rest of the complex.  It\n        also provides the frequency reference to the Master Clock\n        Assembly (MCA) which in turn provides time to the Time\n        Insertion and Distribution Assembly (TID) which provides UTC\n        and SIM-time to the complex.\n \n        JPL's ability to monitor the FTS at each DSCC is limited to\n        the MDA calculated Doppler pseudo-residuals, the Doppler\n        noise, the SSI, and to a system which uses the Global\n        Positioning System (GPS).  GPS receivers at each DSCC receive\n        a one-pulse-per-second pulse from the station's (hydrogen\n        maser referenced) FTS and a pulse from a GPS satellite at\n        scheduled times.  After compensating for the satellite signal\n        delay, the timing offset is reported to JPL where a database\n        is kept.  The clock offsets stored in the JPL database are\n        given in microseconds; each entry is a mean reading of\n        measurements from several GPS satellites and a time tag\n        associated with the mean reading.  The clock offsets provided\n        include those of SPC 10 relative to UTC (NIST), SPC 40\n        relative to SPC 10, etc.\n \n \n    Optics - DSN\n    ============\n      Performance of DSN ground stations depends primarily on size of\n      the antenna and capabilities of electronics.  These are\n      summarized in the following set of tables.  Note that 64-m\n      antennas were upgraded to 70-m between 1986 and 1989.\n      Beamwidth is half-power full angular width.  Polarization is\n      circular; L denotes left circular polarization (LCP), and R\n      denotes right circular polarization (RCP).\n \n \n                           DSS S-Band Characteristics\n \n                               64-m      70-m     34-m     34-m\n           Transmit                                STD      HEF\n           --------           -----     -----    -----    -----\n           Frequency (MHz)    2110-     2110-    2025-     N/A\n                               2120      2120     2120\n           Wavelength (m)     0.142     0.142    0.142     N/A\n           Ant Gain (dBi)                62.7     55.2     N/A\n           Beamwidth (deg)              0.119     0.31     N/A\n           Polarization                L or R   L or R     N/A\n           Tx Power (kW)               20-400       20     N/A\n \n           Receive\n           -------\n           Frequency (MHz)    2270-     2270-    2270-    2200-\n                               2300      2300     2300     2300\n           Wavelength (m)     0.131     0.131    0.131    0.131\n           Ant Gain (dBi)      61.6      63.3     56.2     56.0\n           Beamwidth (deg)              0.108     0.27     0.24\n           Polarization       L & R     L & R   L or R   L or R\n           System Temp (K)       22        20       22       38\n \n                           DSS X-Band Characteristics\n \n                               64-m      70-m     34-m     34-m\n           Transmit                                STD      HEF\n           --------           -----     -----    -----    -----\n           Frequency (MHz)     8495      8495     N/A     7145-\n                                                           7190\n           Wavelength (m)     0.035     0.035     N/A     0.042\n           Ant Gain (dBi)                74.2     N/A        67\n           Beamwidth (deg)                        N/A     0.074\n           Polarization      L or R    L or R     N/A    L or R\n           Tx Power (kW)        360       360     N/A        20\n \n           Receive\n           -------\n           Frequency (MHz)    8400-     8400-    8400-    8400-\n                               8500      8500     8500     8500\n           Wavelength (m)     0.036     0.036    0.036    0.036\n           Ant Gain (dBi)      71.7      74.2     66.2     68.3\n           Beamwidth (deg)              0.031    0.075    0.063\n           Polarization       L & R     L & R    L & R    L & R\n           System Temp (K)       27        20       25       20\n \n \n \n    Electronics - DSN\n    =================\n \n      DSCC Open-Loop Receiver\n      -----------------------\n        The open loop receiver block diagram shown below is for 70-m\n        and 34-m High-Efficiency (HEF) antenna sites.  Based on a\n        tuning prediction file, the POCA controls the DANA\n        synthesizer the output of which (after multiplication) mixes\n        input signals at both S- and X-band to fixed intermediate\n        frequencies for amplification.  These signals in turn are\n        down converted and passed through additional filters until\n        they yield baseband output of up to 25 kHz in width.  The\n        baseband output is digitally sampled by the DSP and either\n        written to magnetic tape or electronically transferred for\n        further analysis.\n \n \n      S-Band                                          X-Band\n     2295 MHz                                        8415 MHz\n      Input                                            Input\n        |                                                |\n        v                                                v\n       ---     ---                              ---     ---\n      | X |<--|x20|<--100 MHz        100 MHz-->|x81|-->| X |\n       ---     ---                              ---     ---\n        |                                                |\n     295|                                                |315\n     MHz|                                                |MHz\n        v                                                v\n       ---     --                               ---     ---\n      | X |<--|x3|<------               ------>|x11|-->| X |\n       ---     --        |115        33|        ---     ---\n        |                |MHz       MHz|                 |\n        |                |             |                 |\n      50|               ---           ---                |50\n     MHz|      72 MHz->| X |         | X |               |MHz\n        v               ---           ---                v\n       ---               ^             ^                ---\n      | X |<--60 MHz     | 43        43|      60 MHz-->| X |\n       ---               |MHz       MHz|                ---\n        |        9.9     |             |      9.9        |\n        |        MHz      -------------       MHz        |\n        |         |             ^              |         |\n      10|         v             |              v         |10\n     MHz|        ---       ----------         ---        |MHz\n        |------>| X |     |   DANA   |       | X |<------|\n        |        ---      |Synthesizr|        ---        |\n        |         |        ----------          |         |\n        v         v             ^              v         v\n     -------   -------          |           -------   -------\n    |Filters| |Filters|    ----------      |Filters| |Filters|\n    |3,4,5,6| |  1,2  |   |   POCA   |     |  1,2  | |3,4,5,6|\n     -------   -------    |Controller|      -------   -------\n        |         |        ----------          |         |\n      10|         |0.1                      0.1|         |10\n     MHz|         |MHz                      MHz|         |MHz\n        v         v                            v         v\n       ---       ---                          ---       ---\n      | X |-   -| X |                        | X |-   -| X |\n       ---  | |  ---                          ---  | |  ---\n        ^   | |   ^                            ^   | |   ^\n        |   | |   |                            |   | |   |\n       10   | |  0.1                          0.1  | |   10\n       MHz  | |  MHz                          MHz  | |  MHz\n            | |                                    | |\n            v v                                    v v\n          Baseband                               Baseband\n           Output                                 Output\n \n \n \n        Reconstruction of the antenna frequency from the frequency of\n        the signal in the recorded data can be achieved through use\n        of one of the following formulas.\n \n        Radio Science IF-VF (RIV) Converter Assembly at 70-m and 34-m\n        High-Efficiency (HEF) antennas:\n \n \n           FSant=3*[POCA+(79/11)*10^6] + 1.95*10^9 -

No information on specific calibration\n      activities is available.  Nominal performance specifications\n      are shown in the tables above.  Additional information may be\n      available in [DSN810-5].\n \n      Prior to each tracking pass, station operators perform a series\n      of calibrations to ensure that systems meet specifications for\n      that operational period.  Included in these calibrations is\n      measurement of receiver system temperature in the configuration\n      to be employed during the pass.  Results of these calibrations\n      are recorded in (hard copy) Controller's Logs for each pass.\n \n      The nominal procedure for initializing open-loop receiver\n      attenuator settings is described below.  In cases where widely\n      varying signal levels are expected, the procedure may be\n      modified in advance or real-time adjustments may be made to\n      attenuator settings.\n \n \n      Open-Loop Receiver Attenuation Calibration\n      ------------------------------------------\n        The open-loop receiver attenuator calibrations are performed\n        to establish the output of the open-loop receivers at a level\n        that will not saturate the analog-to-digital converters.  To\n        achieve this, the calibration is done using a test signal\n        generated by the exciter/translator that is set to the peak\n        predicted signal level for the upcoming pass.  Then the\n        output level of the receiver's video band spectrum envelope\n        is adjusted to the level determined by equation (3) below (to\n        five-sigma).  Note that the SNR in the equation (2) is in dB\n        while the SNR in equation (3) is linear.\n \n \n      Pn = -198.6 + 10*log(SNT) + 10*log(1.2*Fbw)              (1)\n \n      SNR = Ps - Pn                               (SNR in dB)  (2)\n \n      Vrms = sqrt(SNR + 1)/[1 + 0.283*sqrt(SNR)]  (SNR linear) (3)\n \n      where    Fbw = receiver filter bandwidth (Hz)\n               Pn  = receiver noise power (dBm)\n               Ps  = signal power (dBm)\n               SNT = system noise temperature (K)\n               SNR = predicted signal-to-noise ratio\n \n \n \n    Operational Considerations - DSN\n    ================================\n      The DSN is a complex and dynamic 'instrument.' Its performance\n      for Radio Science depends on a number of factors from equipment\n      configuration to meteorological conditions.  No specific\n      information on 'operational considerations' can be given here.\n \n \n    Operational Modes - DSN\n    =======================\n \n      DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem\n      ---------------------------------\n        Pointing of DSCC antennas may be carried out in several ways.\n        For details see the subsection 'DSCC Antenna Mechanical\n        Subsystem' in the 'Subsystem' section.  Binary pointing is\n        the preferred mode for tracking spacecraft; pointing predicts\n        are provided, and the antenna simply follows those.  With\n        CONSCAN, the antenna scans conically about the optimum\n        pointing direction, using closed-loop receiver signal\n        strength estimates as feedback.  In planetary mode, the\n        system interpolates from three (slowly changing) RA-DEC\n        target coordinates; this is 'blind' pointing since there is\n        no feedback from a detected signal.  In sidereal mode, the\n        antenna tracks a fixed point on the celestial sphere.  In\n        'precision' mode, the antenna pointing is adjusted using an\n        optical feedback system.  It is possible on most antennas to\n        freeze z-axis motion of the subreflector to minimize phase\n        changes in the received signal.\n \n \n      DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem\n      -------------------------------\n        The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and\n        the feed horns on all three antennas may be configured so\n        that it is out of the received signal path in order to\n        improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver system.\n        This is known as the 'listen-only' or 'bypass' mode.\n \n \n      Closed-Loop vs. Open-Loop Reception\n      -----------------------------------\n        Radio Science data can be collected in two modes: closed-\n        loop, in which a phase-locked loop receiver tracks the\n        spacecraft signal, or open-loop, in which a receiver samples\n        and records a band within which the desired signal presumably\n        resides.  Closed-loop data are collected using Closed-Loop\n        Receivers, and open-loop data are collected using Open-Loop\n        Receivers in conjunction with the DSCC Spectrum Processing\n        Subsystem (DSP).  See the Subsystems section for further\n        information.\n \n \n      Closed-Loop Receiver AGC Loop\n      -----------------------------\n        The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of\n        three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  Ordinarily it is\n        configured so that expected signal amplitude changes are\n        accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth is\n        ordinarily configured so that expected phase changes can be\n        accommodated while maintaining the best possible loop SNR.\n \n \n      Coherent vs. Non-Coherent Operation\n      -----------------------------------\n        The frequency of the signal transmitted from the spacecraft\n        can generally be controlled in two ways -- by locking to a\n        signal received from a ground station or by locking to an\n        on-board oscillator.  These are known as the coherent (or\n        'two-way') and non-coherent ('one-way') modes, respectively.\n        Mode selection is made at the spacecraft, based on commands\n        received from the ground.  When operating in the coherent\n        mode, the transponder carrier frequency is derived from the\n        received uplink carrier frequency with a 'turn-around ratio'\n        typically of 240/221.  In the non-coherent mode, the downlink\n        carrier frequency is derived from the spacecraft on-board\n        crystal-controlled oscillator.  Either closed-loop or\n        open-loop receivers (or both) can be used with either\n        spacecraft frequency reference mode.  Closed-loop reception\n        in two-way mode is usually preferred for routine tracking.\n        Occasionally the spacecraft operates coherently while two\n        ground stations receive the 'downlink' signal; this is\n        sometimes known as the 'three-way' mode.\n \n \n      DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)\n      ----------------------------------------\n        The DSP can operate in four sampling modes with from 1 to 4\n        input signals.

When in the\n    Mapping Phase of the mission, MOLA provides measurements of the\n    topography of Mars within approximately 120 m diameter footprints\n    and a center-to-center along-track footprint spacing of 300 m along\n    the MGS nadir ground-track.  The elevation measurements are\n    quantized with 1.5 m vertical resolution by the 100 MHz timing\n    interval unit (TIU) and an interpolator, giving it effectively\n    0.375 m resolution.  MOLA profiles are adjusted for orbit and\n    pointing errors using 66 million altimetric crossover constraints.\n    MOLA profiles are assembled into global planetocentric grids\n    referenced to Mars' center-of-mass with an absolute accuracy of\n    approximately 1 m.  Standard data products include NASA level 0\n    (CODMAC Level 2) corrected telemetry, NASA level 1a (CODMAC Level 3)\n    profiles in  engineering and geophysical units, and NASA level 2\n    (CODMAC Level 5) maps at various resolutions of planetary shape\n    (radius) areoid (equipotential datum surface), topography\n    (shape-equipotential), and maps of shot counts per bin. With roughly\n    10,000 usable orbital profiles, each with ascending and descending\n    equator crossings, mapping resolution is limited mainly by the\n    across-track spacing of individual orbits, and by the along-track\n    spacing of MOLA footprints.  At 1/32 degree by 1/32 degree per\n    pixel, more than one half of all pixels contain at least one\n    observation, while higher density occurs at the poles. Products at\n    resolutions of up to 128 pixels per degree are available, in\n    factor-of-two increments, interpolated where necessary by\n    minimum-curvature surfaces under tension [SMITH&WESSEL1990].\n    Special products include images of topographic gradients, kilometer-\n    and footprint-scale roughness, and a global 0.25 x 0.25 degree grid\n    of 1.064 micrometer surface reflectivity.\n \n    All major components of MOLA except for the laser and telescope were\n    designed, built and tested at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center,\n    Greenbelt, MD.\n \n    On June 31, 2001, after firing 670 million shots during 4.5 years of\n    the primary and extended missions and undergoing several hundred\n    power cycles, MOLA ceased operation as an altimeter. A 100 MHz\n    timing oscillator signal, divided down to a 10 Hz interrupt,\n    degraded rapidly and then failed.  Laser firing, controlled in\n    hardware by the 10 Hz signal, is no longer possible, but the\n    receiver electronics are fully operational.  A software patch was\n    uplinked that records at high resolution the detector noise counts\n    in place of laser data, providing a radiometric signal. The\n    background noise counts from the MOLA receiver can be used as a\n    radiometric measurement in the 1.064 micron band.\n \n    In radiometer mode, MOLA is clocked by 8 Hz interrupts from the\n    spacecraft master clock, and the original MOLA 10 Hz interupt has\n    been masked.  Flight software sets the receiver threshold every 10\n    interrupts, to maintain an approximately constant rate of noise\n    triggers. Noise counts are recorded at every interrupt on channels\n    1 and 2, and the totals for a half-frame of 10 interrupts are\n    stored for all four channels in a compressed (pseudo-log) format.\n    The precision  of the measurement is limited by the statistics of\n    the approximately 1000 noise counts per shot. Summing channels 1\n    and 2 increases precision. Each half-frame constitutes a single\n    record with a duration of 1.25 seconds and provides 10 radiometric\n    measurements.  The threshold settings and noise counts are\n    interpreted radiometrically using an analytical model of the MOLA\n    receiver characteristics. This model [SUNETAL1992, SUNETAL2001] has\n    been calibrated with respect to preflight test data and in-flight\n    experience, as well as similar measurements obtained by the Mars\n    Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer Bolometer and by the\n    Hubble Space Telescope. Precision orbit data describing the\n    instrument's position and target location has been added to each\n    record. The precision orbit data is supplied by the MOLA Science\n    Team.\n \n \n  MOLA Science Objectives\n  =======================\n    The primary MOLA objective is to determine globally the topography\n    of Mars at a level suitable for addressing problems in geology and\n    geophysics [ZUBERETAL1992, SMITHETAL1998].  Secondary objectives\n    include characterizing the 1.064 micrometer wavelength surface\n    reflectivity of Mars to contribute to analyses of global surface\n    mineralogy and seasonal albedo changes.  Other objectives include\n    addressing problems in atmospheric circulation and providing\n    geodetic control and topographic context for the assessment of\n    possible future Mars landing sites.\n \n \n  Instrument Specifications\n  =========================\n    The following table summarizes MOLA characteristics.\n \n    Parameter                          Value            Unit\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\n    Physical Characteristics\n    Volume                              0.15            m^3\n    Mass                               26.18            kg\n    Power (TOTAL)                      28.74            W\n    Heater Power                       10.00            W\n \n    Laser Transmitter\n    Laser type                 Q-switched, diode-pumped Nd:YAG*\n    Wavelength                         1.064            micrometer\n    Laser energy                       40-30            mJ pulse^-1\n    Laser power consumption            13.7             W\n    Pulse width                        ~8.5             ns (FWHM**)\n    Pulse repetition rate              10               sec^-1\n    Beam cross-section                 25x25            mm^2\n    Beam divergence                    0.25             mrad\n \n    Altimeter Receiver\n    Telescope type                     Cassegrain\n    Mirror composition                 Gold-coated beryllium\n    Telescope diameter                 0.5              m\n    Focal length                       0.74             m\n    Detector type          Silicon avalanche photodiode (Si APD)\n    Sensitivity                        1                nW\n    Optical filter                     2.2              nm bandpass\n    Field of view                     ~0.85             mrad\n \n    Receiver Electronics\n    Receiver type            Match-filtered leading-edge trigger\n    Time resolution                    10               nsec\n    Range resolution                   1.5              m\n    Pulse energy resolution            20%\n \n    Measurements\n    Footprint size (@ 400 km)          120              m\n    Footprint spacing (@ velocity = 3 km/sec)\n   (center-to-center, along-track)   300                m\n \n    Computer\n    Type                               80C86\n    Data rate                          617.14           bits sec^-1\n \n    * Nd:YAG is neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet.\n    ** FWHM is full width at half maximum.\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n  Operational Considerations\n  ==========================\n    The MOLA instrument measures the round-trip time of flight of\n    infrared laser pulses transmitted from the MGS spacecraft to the\n    martian surface.  The instrument normally operates in a single\n    autonomous mode, in which it produces ranging measurements.\n    Surface topography estimates can be derived from these data, given\n    appropriate corrections for the position and attitude of the\n    spacecraft.\n \n    MOLA's transmitter is a Q-switched, Nd:YAG laser oscillator which\n    is pumped by a 44 bar laser array.  Each bar contains ~1000 AlGaAs\n    (Aluminum, Gallium Arsenide) laser diodes.  The Q-switch controls\n    the emission of the laser, and Nd:YAG refers to the composition of\n    the material that is optically excited to produce laser action:\n    Neodymium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet. The laser emits 8.5-ns-wide\n    (full width at half the maximum pulse amplitude, FWHM) pulses at\n    1.064 micrometers.  The pulse repetition rate is 10 Hz. The\n    pulse energy was 45 mJ at the beginning of the Mapping Phase\n    and 20 mJ at end of mission.  Energy fluctuated somewhat as\n    temperature varied aboard the spacecraft, and dropped several times\n    when individual diode bars failed. The remaining diodes appear\n    to have been operating at full output when the firing signal\n    stopped.  The laser consumed 13.7 W when operating.\n \n    The development of a space-qualified, long-lifetime laser represents\n    one of the primary engineering challenges associated with MOLA.  For\n    comparison, the ruby flashlamp laser altimeters flown on the Apollo\n    15, 16 and 17 missions [KAULAETAL1972, KAULAETAL1973, KAULAETAL1974]\n    each operated for less than 10^4 laser pulses.  High\n    pulse-repetition-rate lasers with lifetimes on the order of 10^9\n    shots have been made possible due to breakthroughs in solid-state\n    laser technology, resulting in improvements in the peak power,\n    brightness, and availability of semiconductor diodes and arrays\n    [CROSSETAL1987, BYERETAL1988].  The key technological advance has\n    been the replacement of the flashlamp, which is the device that has\n    traditionally been used to pump optical energy into the laser rod,\n    with a highly efficient array of laser diodes.  While flashlamp\n    lasers fail catastrophically, diode-pumped lasers such as MOLA's\n    instead undergo a gradual degradation in energy output as individual\n    pump diodes fail.

The instrument\n    cycle time, including collection of the interferogram, mirror\n    flyback, and electronic reset, is 2 sec for 10 cm-1 (single\n    scan) operation, and 4 sec for 5 cm-1 (double scan) operation.\n    The interferometer includes a visible interferometer that is\n    used to generate fringes which are used to control the linear\n    drive servo and to determine position in the interferogram.\n    This system uses two redundant neon lamps that produce an\n    emission line at 703.2 nm for fringe generation and a continuum\n    that is used for a quasi-white-light source for determination\n    of zero path difference.  The finite size and off-axis position\n    of the six detectors results in self-apodization and a spectral\n    shift that is a function of both distance from the axis and\n    optical frequency.  The resulting full-width half-maximum\n    (FWHM) value is ~12.5 cm-1 for 10 cm-1 sampling at 200 cm-1 and\n    15.4 cm-1 at 1650 cm-1.  For the corner detectors and at the\n    highest frequency (shortest wavelength) there is a significant\n    departure from the ideal, with a worst-case degradation to a\n    FWHM of ~24 cm-1.  Because all of the response functions have\n    the same area there is no loss in signal when viewing a smooth\n    continuum scene like Mars.  However, there will be a slight\n    loss in contrast of narrow spectral features due to broadening\n    of the spectral width.  Because the self-apodization is\n    considerable, the data will generally be used without further\n    apodization.  Separate fast fourier transform (FFT) algorithms\n    are used for the center and edge detectors in order to\n    partially correct for the different spectral shifts introduced\n    into these detectors.  As a result, the data generated by the\n    two FFTs will have approximately the same frequency sampling.\n \n \n   Table 1  TES Performance Characteristics\n \n   Parameter                                Expected Performance\n   --------------------------------------------------------------------\n   NEDe in spectrometer channels            0.002 @ 270 K and 10 micron\n   NEDT in spectrometer channels            0.04K @ 270 K and 10 micron\n   NEDr in solar reflectance channel        0.1% of solar flux\n   NEDT in thermal bolometric channel       0.1K @ 270K\n   Spectral resolution                      5, 10 cm-1\n   Spectral range                           200 to ~1600 cm-1\n   Spatial resolution                       3 km\n \n  (NEDT is the noise-equivalent delta temperature)\n \n \n   Table 2  Design Parameters for the Thermal Emission Spectrometer\n \n   Spectral Range\n   --------------------------------------------------------------------\n   interferometer                 200 to ~1600 cm-1 (6.0 -50 micron)\n   radiometer                     5.5 to 100 micron and 0.3-2.7 micron\n   Spectral resolution of         10 cm-1 and 5 cm-1\n      interferometer\n   Field of view (FOV)            16.6 mrad downtrack,\n                                  24.9 mrad crosstrack\n   Instantaneous Field of View    8.3 mrad square\n      (IFOV)\n   Telescope Aperture\n      interferometer              15.2 cm diameter Cassegrain\n      radiometer                  1.5 cm diameter off-axis reflecting\n   Pointing mirror\n      range                       90 forward, 90 aft\n      step size                   ~ 0.25 mrad\n   Detectors                      uncooled deuterated triglycine sulfate\n                                  (DTGS) pyroelectric\n      spectrometer channel:       6-element array; each 1.75 mm diam\n                                    NEP = 3.01x10-11 W-Hz-1/2\n                                    responsivity = 1000 V/W\n      bolometer channels:         6-element array; each 1mm x 1mm\n                                     NEP = 2 x10-11 W-Hz1/2\n                                     responsivity = 1000 V/W\n   Michelson mirror travel        +- 0.25 mm and +- 0.50 mm\n   Mirror velocity                0.0295 cm/sec\n   Neon fringe reference          703.2 nm\n      wavelength\n   Sample rate                    839 samples/sec/detector\n   Cycle time per measurement     2 sec and 4 sec\n   Number of samples per          1344\n      interferogram\n   Number of bits per sample      16\n   Number of spectral samples     143, 286\n   Number of bits per spectral    12\n      sample\n   Data bit rates                 668, 1664, 4992 bits/sec\n   Size                           21.08 x 34.52 x 39.85 cm\n   Mass                           14.47 kg\n   Power                          10.6 Watts (ave.)\n \n \n  Scientific Objectives\n  =====================\n    The scientific objectives of the Thermal Emission Spectrometer\n    (TES) investigation include the following:\n \n    (1) Determine the composition and distribution of surface\n        materials.\n \n    (2) Determine the composition, particle size, and spatial and\n        temporal distribution of suspended dust.\n \n    (3) Determine the location, temperature, height, and water\n        abundance of H2O clouds.\n \n    (4) Determine the composition, seasonal behavior, total energy\n        balance, and physical properties of the polar caps.\n \n    (5) Determine the particle size distribution of rocks and fines\n        on the surface.\n \n \n  Calibration\n  ===========\n    The TES instrument was radiometrically, spectrally, and\n    spatially calibrated prior to delivery.  Three categories of\n    calibration requirements were considered: absolute accuracy of\n    all three bands, relative accuracy of spectral measurements\n    within the spectrometer, and calibration stability over the\n    lifetime of the instrument.  The spectrometer and thermal\n    bolometric channels were calibrated in a thermal/vacuum chamber\n    using blackbody reference sources operated over the expected\n    Martian temperature range of 130 to >310 K.  The calibration\n    sequence was repeated for instrument temperatures over the\n    operating temperature range.\n \n    The solar reflectance channels were calibrated under ambient\n    conditions using filament lamps traceable to National Institute\n    of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards and a diffuser\n    plate with known bidirectional reflectance distribution\n    function properties.  Altering the distance from the lamps to\n    the plate was used to vary the radiance over the expected\n    dynamic range.  The absolute accuracy of the calibration was\n    better than 5%.  This calibration was confirmed by measurements\n    in the thermal/vacuum chamber over the expected instrument\n    operating temperature range.\n \n    The inflight radiometric calibration is performed using\n    observations of space (zero level) and an internal blackbody\n    (gain).  The instrument has an unobstructed view to space with\n    the line of sight at 85 degrees from nadir in at least one\n    direction, with an unobstructed half angle of 10.75 degrees on\n    either side of this line of sight.  These calibration\n    measurements allow the instrument response function and zero\n    levels to be determined and removed from the measured spectra\n    prior to transmission to Earth.  This calibration is performed\n    internally to permit coadding of spectra from more than one\n    detector and from more than one measurement.  The internal\n    blackbody and lamp calibration sources will be viewed by\n    rotation of the pointing mirror, providing a complete\n    end-to-end system calibration.\n \n \n  Operational Considerations\n  ==========================\n    None\n \n \n  Detectors\n  =========\n    Each sensor array consists of uncooled deuterated triglycine\n    sulfate (DTGS) pyroelectric detectors.  A narrow bandpass\n    filter is used to isolate the emission line at 703.2 nm for\n    fringe generation and the continuum is used for a\n    quasi-white-light source for determination of zero path\n    difference.  A silicon photodiode detector is used for each of\n    these functions.\n \n \n  Electronics\n  ===========\n    The outputs from all TES channels are digitized at 16 bits,\n    processed, and formatted before being sent to the spacecraft\n    Payload Data Subsystem (PDS).  The outputs of the\n    interferometer receive the following processing within the\n    instrument before transfer to the PDS:\n \n    1) selectable apodization;\n    2) Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) of data from all six\n       interferometer channels;\n    3) correction for gain and offsets;\n    4) data editing and aggregation;\n    5) data compression; and\n    6) formatting for the PDS.\n \n \n  Filters\n  =======\n    None\n \n \n  Optics\n  ======\n    The interferometer telescope is a reflecting Cassegrain\n    configuration with a focal ratio of f/4 and an intermediate\n    field stop which limits stray light from being admitted to the\n    interferometer and aft optics sections of the optical system.\n    The afocal output beam of the telescope is 1.524 cm in\n    diameter.  After passing through the Michelson interferometer\n    the energy is focused by an off-axis mirror on to a 2 x 3 array\n    of field stops.  The focal ratio at the field stops is also\n    f/4.  Behind each stop is a field lens operating at\n    approximately f/1 and a pyroelectric detector.\n \n    A separate 1.5-cm-diameter reflecting telescope, collimated\n    with the main telescope and using the same pointing mirror, is\n    used for the thermal and albedo radiometer channels.  The\n    optical system consists of a single off-axis paraboloidal\n    mirror operating at f/8.\n \n \n  Location\n  ========\n    Payload deck of MGS (+Z panel), boresighted with MOC\n \n \n  Operational Modes\n  =================\n    The overall science objectives of the TES experiment will be\n    addressed during the standard mission through a variety of\n    observation types.  These include:\n \n    (1) nadir pointing observations of the surface and atmosphere\n        collected along the spacecraft groundtrack,\n \n    (2) surface mosaics constructed by observing a particular\n        region forward, nadir, and then aft along the groundtrack,\n \n    (3) limb observations produced by scanning the pointing mirror\n        to and across the limb, and\n \n    (4) emission phase functions produced by viewing a particular\n        region at a limited set of emission angles fore and aft.\n \n    In addition, the TES processor will operate in a wide variety\n    of data collection and processing modes that will allow great\n    flexibility in the types and data volume of observations that\n    will be made.  Substantial on-board data processing is\n    necessitated by data rate constraints.  A variety of observing\n    modes will be used.  These will be based on:\n \n    (1) combining outputs from selected combinations of detectors\n        (spatial averaging),\n \n    (2) retention of limited numbers of spectral points (spectral\n        editing) and\n \n    (3) averaging results over several instrument cycles (temporal\n        averaging).\n \n    Data modes will be selected, depending on position in the orbit\n    and on scientific requirements, that limit the variable data\n    flow into the internal TES buffer to an orbitally averaged\n    level consistent with the telemetry rate.  Internal tables will\n    be used to select between the possible operational modes.  For\n    example, the full sampling rate can be utilized over the\n    warmest region of the planet, whereas data can be spectrally\n    and spatially averaged at night and over the poles to decrease\n    the data volume while increasing the signal-to-noise ratio.\n    Control of the instrument parameters and processor activities\n    will be accomplished using an internal command language and\n    internal tables to select between the possible operational\n    modes.  These modes include control of the pointing mirror\n    position and motion, spectral selection, spatial and temporal\n    averaging and editing, and data compression.  The basic\n    instrument parameters will be set for each two-second\n    observation.  Sequences will be constructed to form a\n    self-contained set of observations; for example, calibration\n    observations followed by three minutes of nadir viewing.  Orbit\n    Schedules will be constructed from a list of Sequences, each\n    timed to begin at a specified time following the nighttime\n    equator crossing.\n \n    Two types of Schedules will run in parallel:\n \n    1) a basic observing plan designed to be used repetitively; and\n \n    2) a targeting Schedule to be used for specific, targeted\n       observations that vary from orbit to orbit.\n \n    Finally, a Mission Plan will be constructed and stored within\n    the instrument.  It will contain the Schedules for the next 3\n    to 18 days of operation.  Using this scheme the TES instrument\n    can be controlled completely internally using minimum number of\n    uplink commands, yet utilizing the full, inherent flexibility\n    of a microprocessor-controlled instrument.\n \n \n    Mapping Operations\n    ------------------\n      Because of the limited (9 km) cross-track FOV, the TES\n      instrument will build up a global image using multiple\n      orbits, with approximately 200 days required to obtain full\n      coverage at the equator.  During the mission, the TES could\n      observe each point on the equator three times and each point\n      on the planet an average of 4.7 times.  Given the likelihood\n      of dust obscuration during a substantial portion of the\n      mission, this coverage may be significantly reduced.  It will\n      therefore be necessary to acquire observations in a well\n      defined, systematic manner.  Seasons of highest surface\n      temperature will be chosen for surface compositional mapping,\n      and opportunities provided by increased spacecraft data rate\n      will be incorporated into the observing plan.  Observations\n      of temporal phenomena, such as dust storms, polar cap growth\n      and retreat, seasonal pressure variations, and atmospheric\n      phenomena, will be incorporated into the basic plan and\n      collected whenever possible.\n \n \n    Nadir Observations\n    ------------------\n      The nominal TES operating mode will provide a nadir oriented\n      view of the planet, utilizing all three of the cross-track\n      IFOVs.  These observations will be assembled as part of the\n      standard data reduction procedure into global maps of the\n      surface observations.\n \n \n    Emission Phase Angle Observations\n    ---------------------------------\n      Multiple emission angle observations will provide information\n      on the scattering properties of the surface and atmosphere\n      over regional areas.  Because of planetary rotation (0.24\n      km/sec at the equator) it will not be possible to view\n      exactly the same surface point at multiple emission angles on\n      a single spacecraft revolution.  However, regional\n      characteristics can be determined in one revolution and\n      observations from different revolutions may be combined to\n      refine surface photometric estimates.  Individual emission\n      angle sequences will consist of 2-5 off-nadir views spaced at\n      fixed angles.\n \n \n    Surface Mosaics\n    ---------------\n      The TES instrument has the capability to construct mosaics up\n      to 50 km wide by 110 km long from a single revolution with\n      little loss of spatial resolution by utilizing the planetary\n      rotation.  These observations will permit direct comparison\n      with Mars Observing camera and Viking images, and will permit\n      the study of regional features, such as dune fields, wind\n      streaks, and polar lanes on a single orbit.\n \n \n    Atmospheric Observations\n    ------------------------\n      A wide range of atmospheric observations will be accomplished\n      using the TES instrument.  These utilize both limb scans and\n      variable emission angle observations of the surface and\n      atmosphere.  The observing strategy uses a combination of\n      nadir sounding, fore and aft limb scans, and variable\n      emission angle (nominally+-60 deg ) observations to allow\n      retrieval of vertical temperature profiles, atmospheric\n      aerosol characterization, determination of condensates in the\n      north polar hood, measurement of water ice and vapor and\n      possibly O3, pressure retrievals under high surface\n      temperature conditions, and characterization of localized\n      dust storms.\n \n \n    Observing Strategy\n    ------------------\n      The TES flight software has been programmed with four default\n      operating modes to allow data collection immediately upon\n      instrument turn-on and in the event of an interruption in\n      instrument commanding.  This illustrates the level of\n      complexity and flexibility that can be programmed into the\n      TES observing strategy.  A default mode has been designed to\n      provide 28, uniformly spaced atmospheric limb observations,\n      distributed in both fore and aft viewing directions.  In\n      addition, it optimizes the data collection, with full\n      spectral and spatial data obtained during the day, 6 x 9 km\n      data at half spatial resolution collected over the poles, and\n      12 x 9 km data at full spectral resolution collected at\n      night.  Emission phase observations and limb occultation\n      observations are also collected to permit characterization of\n      polar ices, clouds, and the atmosphere.  Actual, mapping\n      orbit observations will vary from this default case, in order\n      to optimize seasonal viewing opportunities, but will probably\n      maintain the basic structure outlined above.\n \n \n  Subsystems\n  ==========\n    None\n \n \n  Measured Parameters\n  ===================\n    Spectral radiance (spectrometer) - W cm-2 str-1/cm-1\n    Integrated radiance (bolometer channels) - W cm-2 str-1\n \n  Principal Investigator\n  ======================\n    Philip R.

The analyzer has a narrow energy pass band (about 25%), which\n    can be set by the inner hemisphere potential.  This potential is\n    generated by a programmable high voltage supply, which is swept\n    through its range to measure electrons from 10eV to 20KeV.  Electrons\n    are imaged onto the MCP, which multiplies individual electrons by a\n    factor of about a million.  This cloud of electrons then hits a\n    resistive anode.  The relative signal level on each end of the anode\n    is measured by the Pulse Position Analyzer (PPA) to determine the\n    location on the anode that the electron cloud landed.  This location\n    translates into the direction in the field-of-view plane the incident\n    electron was coming from.  The output of the PPA is an 8 bit digital\n    value proportional to the incident direction, from 0 to 360 deg.\n \n    This information is run through a Pitch Angle Mapper (PAM) which\n    sorts the events into 16 pitch angle bins, which are then counted in\n    a bank of counters.  The PAM is programmed by the main electronics\n    package to convert the PPA output to pitch angle bins based on the\n    measured magnetic field vector provided by the magnetometer sensors.\n    The counters are read out to the main electronics package over a\n    serial interface 32 times a second, synchronized to the telemetry\n    clock (RTI).  The analyzer control voltages and PAM are programmed by\n    the main electronics package via another serial interface.\n \n \n  Platform Mounting Descriptions\n  ==============================\n    The ER is mounted on the instrument deck.  The ER's symmetry axis\n    (Z, which is orthogonal to its FOV) is orthogonal to the spacecraft\n    Z axis.  The projection of the symmetry axis onto the spacecraft XY\n    plane is 10 degrees from the -Y axis and 80 degrees from the +X\n    axis.\n \n \n  Principal Investigator\n  ======================\n    The Principal Investigator for the MAG/ER experiment is Mario\n    Acuna.  The Lead Investigator for the Electron Reflectometer is\n    Robert P. Lin.\n \n    For more information on the Electron Reflectometer see\n    [ACUNAETAL1992].\n \n \n  Scientific Objectives\n  =====================\n    See the MISSION_OBJECTIVES_SUMMARY item in the file MISSION.CAT.\n    (This file is in the CATALOG directory on this disk.)\n \n \n  Operational Considerations\n  ==========================\n    Parts of the spacecraft are within the instrument's FOV.  During pre-\n    mapping, the stowed high gain antenna (HGA) blocked ~70 degrees.\n    Once the HGA was deployed, only small amounts of blockage remained,\n    which are caused by attitude control thrusters and the -Y solar array\n    gimbal and yoke assembly.  One effect this has on the measurements is\n    to block ambient electrons from the directions of the obstacles. This\n    is most clearly seen at high energies (> 100 eV), which are only\n    slightly deflected by the spacecraft floating potential.  In\n    addition, when these obstacles are illuminated by the sun, they emit\n    photoelectrons up to ~50 eV, which can enter the ER aperture and\n    elevate the counting rate at low energies.  The detailed signature of\n    this effect depends on the illumination pattern as the spacecraft\n    rotates, which is a function of the angles between Earth, Mars, and\n    the Sun.  These angles vary over the course of the mission.\n    Photoelectron contamination has not been removed from the data;\n    however, the presence of contamination is readily identified in the\n    low energy channels (< 50 eV) by a sharp (nearly discontinuous)\n    increase in counting rate which appears once per spacecraft spin\n    (~100 minutes during pre-mapping, ~120 minutes during mapping).  The\n    contamination disappears as abruptly as it appears.\n \n    For a duration of ~4 minutes every half-spin of the spacecraft,\n    sunlight can directly enter the ER aperture and scatter inside the\n    instrument, creating secondary electrons. A tiny fraction of these\n    photons and secondary electrons can scatter down to the anode and\n    create a ''pulse'' of spurious counts.  This sunlight pulse appears\n    at all energies, but is most noticeable from 10 to 80 eV and above\n    1 keV.  Sunlight pulses have not been removed from the data.\n \n    The instrument's energy scale is referenced to spacecraft ground.\n    In sunlight, spacecraft ground floats a few volts positive relative\n    to the plasma in which the spacecraft is immersed.  Electrons are\n    accelerated by the spacecraft potential before they can enter the\n    ER aperture, thus all energies are shifted upward by a few eV.  In\n    addition to shifting the electron energy, the trajectories of low\n    energy electrons can be significantly bent by electric fields\n    around the spacecraft.  Thus, the energy scale and imaging\n    characteristics are relatively poor at the lowest energies (10-30\n    eV), becoming much more accurate at higher energies.\n \n \n  Calibration\n  ===========\n    The ER may be put into one of 5 automated calibration modes by\n    command. These modes (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) are designed to measure\n    specific instrument performance characteristics.  Each mode\n    consists of a sequence of steps, each of which lasts one packet\n    collection interval. A calibration mode sequence can be programmed\n    to repeat from 1 to 255 times.  After the selected number of\n    iterations has been performed, the system is returned to its\n    original state, with a few minor exceptions. These exceptions\n    include:\n \n      1. The test pulser is turned off at the end of Cal mode 1,\n         independent of its original state.\n      2. The ER_PAM_FIX table and ER_PAM_OFFSET value are modified in\n         all Cal modes.\n \n    In all modes except mode 6, the telemetry format is identical to\n    the normal format, but the instrument is operated differently, as\n    described below, except that Case Current telemetry data is usually\n    garbled.  In mode 6, a block of each packet is used for the ADC\n    measurements, and the rest of the packet is scrapped.\n \n    In all Calibration modes, the PAM_FIXED mode is used (see below),\n    and the PAM_FIX table and PAM_OFFSET value are modified.  The\n    nominal values for the table are described below, but all can be\n    reprogrammed.\n \n \n    (1) ER Calibration Mode 1 (Test Pulser)\n \n \n    This mode is used to stimulate the instrument when the analyzer is\n    not functional (high voltages off).  It can also be used to\n    calibrate the PPA anode.  If the instrument high voltage is turned\n    on, real particle counts will be mixed with the test pulser counts.\n    The PAM is loaded with a fixed map which maps the region near the\n    pulser input with highest resolution (1 PPA bin per counter), with\n    the rest of the anode going into counter number 15 (the last pitch\n    angle bin).  Next the test pulser is turned on.  Its amplitude is\n    increased linearly from zero to full scale synchronous with the\n    normal one second analyzer voltage sweep, so that what is normally\n    energy step in the telemetry is now test pulser amplitude.  This is\n    repeated for one packet duration, and then the cycle is repeated\n    for the next packet with the next test pulser.  The whole sequence\n    lasts four ER packet intervals, as shown in the table below:\n \n \n        Packet Counter            Test Pulser    PAM_OFFSET\n            0                     A (30  deg)        13\n            1                     B (180 deg)       120\n            2                     C (330 deg)       227\n            3                     B (180 deg)       120\n \n \n    PAM_OFFSET is set to center the nominal test pulser location on the\n    high resolution part of the PAM.  The values of PAM_OFFSET and the\n    sequence of test pulsers are programmable.\n \n \n    (2) ER Calibration Mode 2 (MCP Bias)\n \n \n    This mode is used to determine the optimum setting of the MCP bias\n    voltage.  The instrument continues to operate in the normal mode,\n    except that the MCP bias voltage is modified once per packet, over\n    a cycle of 8 ER packets.  Also, the PAM_FIXED mode is used, with\n    the PAM table set to 16 equal 22.5 deg fixed image plane bins.\n    This allows a look at MCP efficiency as a function of location on\n    the MCP.  If there is one particular point on the MCP that should\n    be monitored, the PAM_FIX table generated for Cal mode 2 can be\n    modified in ER_CAL_PAM table - see discussion above.\n \n    Assuming conditions are stable over the test cycle time, the data\n    from the different MCP voltage settings can be compared on the\n    ground, and an optimum voltage can be selected and commanded up.\n    The pattern of MCP voltages used is programmable using the\n    ER_CAL2_MCPOFFSET command; the default values are +3, +6, 3, 0, -3,\n    -6, -3, 0.  The values from this table are added to the current MCP\n    DAC setting.  The last entry in this table should be 0; the MCP\n    will be left at the voltage level of the final entry.  Note that\n    the default table has steps of about 48 volts.\n \n \n    (3) ER Calibration Mode 3 (Background)\n \n \n    Calibration mode 3 is used to measure the instrument background\n    counting rate from noise and cosmic rays.  The instrument sweep is\n    stopped at about 10eV with the deflector attenuator set on.  The\n    PAM_FIX table and MCP bias are set and sequenced identically to Cal\n    mode 2, so that the background can be measured as a function of MCP\n    bias voltage. Unfortunately, unlike the case of Mars Observer, one\n    cannot completely shut off incoming electrons, so this mode is of\n    marginal usefulness.\n \n \n    (4) ER Calibration Mode 4 (Deflector Attenuator)\n \n \n    This mode is used to inter-calibrate the instrument sensitivity\n    with and without the deflector attenuator on.  This is done by\n    disabling normal sweeps, and fixing the analyzer voltage at the\n    place where the grid attenuator is normally turned on.  For the\n    first packet, the attenuator is off, and for the second packet it\n    is turned on (the cycle lasts 2 ER packet intervals).  The PAM_FIX\n    table is loaded for 16 equally spaced 22.5 deg bins.\n \n \n    (5) ER Calibration Mode 6 (Voltage Calibration)\n \n \n    This mode is used to measure the various analyzer voltages which\n    normally vary during a packet via the analog housekeeping ADC.  The\n    voltages are swept over their range slowly, and the ER analog\n    housekeeping ADC read-out time slot is dedicated to the measurement\n    (giving 4 samples per second).  The voltage sweeps are synchronized\n    to the ADC read-out times. The data from the ADC is loaded directly\n    into the ER telemetry packet right after the header, taking 48 16\n    bit words (48 12-bit ADC samples per packet, with the 4 MSB of each\n    word set to zero).  Normal telemetry data is lost, and the rest of\n    the packet will be garbled.  The mode consists of 2 different\n    cycles, each looking at different voltages, and each taking 1\n    packet interval to complete.\n \n \n    (5a) ER Calibration Mode 6, Cycle 1 (Analyzer and Deflector\n         Attenuator Voltages)\n \n \n    This cycle measures 32 samples of the analyzer voltage, using every\n    4th value of the normal analyzer sweep table.  Note that the gain\n    of the housekeeping channel switches when the gain of the\n    programming DAC for the analyzer is changed, and by the same\n    amount, so to correctly interpret the measurements, the setting of\n    the gain bit must be known for each measurement.  The MSB of each\n    sample contains the gain bit of the DAC for this purpose.  The\n    remaining 16 values are measurements of the attenuator grid made\n    while the analyzer and grid voltages are programmed in their normal\n    pattern over the second half of the sweep table, again using every\n    4th entry of the table.\n \n \n    (5b) ER Calibration Mode 6, Cycle 2 (Case Voltage)\n \n \n    The second packet of ER Cal mode 6 contain measurements of Vcase\n    (the case voltage), Icase (the case current), and Icase*80 (the\n    high gain Icase measurement), while the Case Voltage DAC is ramped\n    over its full range in 16 steps (starting at 0, 16 DAC steps each\n    sample). The data is ordered as 16 Vcase samples, followed by 16\n    Icase samples, and finally 16 Icase*80 samples.\n \n \n  Operational Modes\n  =================\n \n    (1) Energy sweep and attenuator\n \n \n    Data is accumulated over one or more energy sweeps.  Each energy\n    sweep takes 1 second, and is divided into 128 equal steps\n    (synchronized to the RTI).  The analyzer high voltage is swept from\n    high to low energy during the sweep in an approximately exponential\n    decay.  Data is collected for 16 pitch angle bins 30 times each\n    sweep, dividing phase space into 16 pitch angles by 30 energy bands\n    over the energy range of the instrument. Note that data is not\n    collected during the first 4 energy steps when the analyzer high\n    voltage is re-charged, or during the 4 steps that the attenuator\n    grid voltage is charged up.\n \n    The sweep voltage is controlled via the ER sweep registers to a 12\n    bit DAC with a gain switch.  The gain switch changes the sweep\n    voltage by a factor of 16 to increase the accuracy of the voltage\n    setting at the low end.  The software generates a log sweep pattern\n    on turn-on (which may be over-written by ground command), and\n    automatically sets the gain bit appropriately.\n \n    At a selectable point in the sweep, the deflection attenuator turns\n    on (default is at step 124, which means it never turns on).  This\n    decreases the sensitivity of the instrument by a factor of 43.5.\n    This is needed to avoid saturating the instrument at the low energy\n    end (where there are typically a lot of electrons), while allowing\n    maximum sensitivity at the high energy (where there are few\n    electrons).  When energized, the deflectors bend electrons from the\n    normal aperture out of the analyzer field of view, while\n    simultaneously bending electrons from the lower, attenuated\n    aperture into the analyzer field of view.  The deflection supply\n    runs at 8 times the analyzer high voltage,  but the supply tops out\n    at about 600 volts, and works only in the low gain range of the\n    analyzer high voltage.  The sweep voltage pauses while the grid\n    attenuator voltage comes on for one accumulation sector time, and\n    the data collected from that interval is discarded.\n \n \n    (2) PAM-variable Mode: (onboard pitch angle sorting)\n \n \n    The events are converted into 16 pitch angle bins, corresponding to\n    the 16 counters, using the PAM table.  This table is generated by\n    the software based on the direction of the magnetic field vector.\n    The PAM table is updated every 2, 4, or 8 seconds at 1296, 648, and\n    324bps respectively.  A one second average of the magnetic field\n    samples is computed for this purpose.  Offsets are then subtracted\n    from a programmable table.  Next, the vector is rotated into ER\n    sensor coordinates using a variable rotation array set by the solar\n    array motion model (see below), followed by a second fixed rotation\n    matrix.  The vector is then normalized and the azimuthal angle\n    (PHI) and cosine of the elevation angle (COSTH) are computed.  PHI\n    is the angle around the FOV plane, coded in an 8 bit number such\n    that 256=360 deg, zero degrees being at the anode break point,\n    increasing clockwise as viewed from the top of the analyzer (the\n    anode break point is 135 deg clockwise from the RPA aperture).\n    COSTH is the cosine of the elevation angle out of the FOV plane,\n    zero degrees being is the image plane.  COSTH is always positive,\n    since the sign is unimportant for PAM table computation.  These\n    quantities are the basis of the PAM table generation, and are\n    transmitted in the ER packet so that the PAM table can be\n    reconstructed on the ground for computing the bin weighting.\n \n    The PAM table is generated by computing the image plane location of\n    the pitch angle bin boundaries, and then filling in the rest of the\n    table, using the relationship:\n \n \n      Bin = PHI +- Cos-1(COSPAi/COSTH)\n \n \n      where:\n       Bin is the image plane bin corresponding to pitch angle boundary # i\n       COSPAi is the cosine of the i-th pitch angle boundary\n       +- is the 'plus-or-minus' sign, normally represented by a + sign\n            above a - sign, but written here as +- for typographical\n            reasons.\n \n \n    The COSPAi are programmable.\n \n \n    (3) PAM-fixed Mode.\n \n \n    This computation can be bypassed by going to a 'Fixed' PAM table,\n    which is independent of the magnetic field direction.  This can be\n    done by command or automatically during calibration cycles.  The\n    'fixed' map is characterized by a set of 16 image plane boundaries\n    and a rotation of that pattern similar in function to PHI.\n \n    Before the PAM table is loaded into the ER, the table is masked to\n    remove a programmable set of 'bad' regions.  These are parts of the\n    image plane which are noisy or which have objects in the FOV\n    distorting the trajectories.  This table defaults to 'none'.\n \n \n  Measured Parameters\n  ===================\n    The ER measures particle counts from 1 to 507904.  The instrument\n    integrates for 0.0625 seconds at each energy channel every 2\n    seconds. The noise level is about 10 counts per second at all\n    energies.","is_prime":true,"tools":[]},{"tags":["Magnetometer"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mag.mgs","display_name":"MGS Magnetometer","display_description":"Abstract\n  ========\n    The Mars Global Surveyor magnetic field instrument consists of\n    dual, triaxial fluxgate magnetometers, capable of measuring fields\n    between +/- 4 nT and +/- 65536 nT. Automated range switching allows\n    the instrument to maintain maximum digital resolution over a wide\n    range of field strengths.\n \n    The text of this instrument description has been abstracted from\n    the instrument paper [ACUNAETAL1992]:\n \n      Acuna, M.

Please review the published material for a\n    complete description of the instrument.\n \n \n  Scientific Objectives\n  =====================\n    The primary objective of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) magnetic\n    field experiment is to establish the nature of the magnetic field\n    of Mars. This includes determining whether or not Mars has a global\n    field of internal origin indicating either present or past dynamo\n    field generation. The existence of an internally generated field\n    would place significant constraints on the composition, thermal\n    state, and dynamics of the interior of the planet.\n \n    Even if dynamo activity ceased as the planet cooled, there is\n    evidence that dynamo activity existed in the past. Remanent\n    magnetization has been observed in meteorites that are widely\n    believed to have originated on Mars [BOGARD&JOHNSON1983]. An\n    important objective of the magnetic field investigation is to\n    identify and characterize crustal remanent magnetization. Magnetic\n    anomaly maps, together with geological data will provide a history\n    of Martian magnetism and crustal evolution.\n \n    Previous missions to Mars have determined that if there is a global\n    magnetic field at Mars it must be small [LUHMANN1991]. Remanent\n    magnetic fields are also likely to be small [ACUNAETAL1992]. In\n    order to accurately measure magnetic fields of Martian origin, the\n    nature of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field\n    interactions with Mars must be well determined.\n \n \n  Calibration\n  ===========\n    The flight software incorporated into the on-board data processor\n    includes diagnostic and self-calibration routines [ACUNAETAL1992].\n    On-board calibration sequences provide the currents required for\n    determination of the gain of each axis sensor for the various\n    dynamic ranges, as well as for determination of electronic offsets\n    by reversal of the polarity of the signals processed by the\n    magnetometer electronics. In addition, spacecraft maneuvers will be\n    performed that will allow the spacecraft field and sensor offsets\n    to be determined independently.\n \n \n  Operational Considerations\n  ==========================\n    The magnetometer power consumption is 375 mW in zero field and\n    increases with the magnitude of the measured field up to 420 mW.\n    The typical rms noise level in the sensors is 0.006 nT over a 10 Hz\n    bandwidth. The zero-level stability is less than 0.15 nT over the\n    range of -40 to +60 degrees Centigrade and for durations up to a\n    year. The upper range of 65,536 nT allows the instrument to be\n    operated in the Earth's magnetic field without special shields or\n    field cancellation magnets.\n \n \n  Detectors\n  =========\n    The MGS magnetometer experiment consists of two, fully redundant,\n    fluxgate magnetometers. There are two sensor triads, two sets\n    of electronics, and two power converter packages. Either sensor\n    triad can be connected to either electronics package. Only one of\n    the two systems is powered at any time. The other system is powered\n    off and maintained in a standby state for redundancy.\n \n    The detectors are constructed using the ring core geometry, which\n    has been shown to have excellent performance characteristics in\n    terms of long-term zero-level stability and drive power\n    requirements. The magnetic material used to manufacture the sensors\n    in an advanced molybdenum-permalloy alloy developed for low-noise,\n    high-stability applications.\n \n    The MGS spacecraft does not have a magnetometer boom to mount the\n    sensors on as the original Mars Observer spacecraft did. Instead,\n    the two sensor packages are mounted on the solar panel arrays.\n \n    The following diagram shows dimensions required for determination\n    of locations of the MAG sensors relative to

Instead each pair of gimbals is considered as a single\n      gimbal having two degrees of rotation. These frame can be\n      considered as 'nominal' solar array position frames since they\n      specify gimbal orientation and do not take into account any\n      additional rotations/transformation that can (did) occur due to\n      incomplete deployment of an array.\n \n      'MGS_+Y_SOLAR_ARRAY' and 'MGS_-Y_SOLAR_ARRAY' frames are\n      associated with the +Y and -Y solar array yokes respectively.\n      These frames are 'fixed offset' frames whose orientation is\n      specified by a set of Euler angles relative to the corresponding\n      frames associated with gimbals.

Analog\n    data are anti-alias filtered and then sent to a twelve bit\n    (12-bit) successive approximation analog to digital (A/D) converter\n    that is controlled by a microprocessor. Variable time resolution\n    data are derived from the basic measurements and the spacecraft\n    telemetry mode. The microprocessor activates the automatic gain\n    control logic in the electronics. If the magnitude of the measured\n    vector component falls within upper or lower guard bands (256 data\n    numbers), then the range (scale factor) is incremented or\n    decremented to maintain maximum digital resolution. Range\n    adjustments change the dynamic range and digital quantization by a\n    factor of four.\n \n         Range        Field Strength     Quantization\n         --------------------------------------------\n           0            +/-     4 nT          .002 nT\n           1            +/-    16 nT          .008 nT\n           2            +/-    64 nT          .032 nT\n           3            +/-   256 nT          .128 nT\n           4            +/-  1024 nT          .512 nT\n           5            +/-  4096 nT         2.048 nT\n           6            +/- 16384 nT         8.192 nT\n           7            +/- 65536 nT        32.768 nT\n \n    The DPU unit's primary function is to acquire the magnetic field\n    data and package it with instrument state and housekeeping data in\n    a form that can be picked up and transmitted to the ground by the\n    Payload Data System (PDS). The system consists of a master\n    executive program that is resident in ROM. The DPU uses the 80C86\n    microprocessor and associated memory and peripheral devices. Default\n    parameter tables used for data processing are stored in ROM but can\n    be modified by ground command. Parameters such as sensor zero\n    levels, alignment matrices, scale factors, etc. are expected to be\n    updated periodically under normal operating conditions. RAM memory\n    is used to double buffer data while packets are being created and\n    accessed by the PDS. Double buffering allows a completed packet to\n    be read out while a new packet is being created without access\n    conflicts between the instrument and the PDS. Data collection and\n    processing routines are interrupt driven by a real time interrupt\n    (RTI) signal provided eight times per second by the onboard PDS.\n    The clock is multiplied four times (32 Hz) and is the fundamental\n    timing signal for all processes in the instrument.\n \n    Data compression techniques are used to maximize data return within\n    the bandwidth allocated to the experiment. Raw magnetometer data are\n    averaged and then 6-bit differenced between adjacent averages. The\n    differences are combined with periodic 12-bit 'full-words' and\n    formatted into data packets. If the differences exceed the dynamic\n    range of six bits, the system folds the values (modulo 64) over\n    rather than saturating. This allows the reconstruction of rapidly\n    varying fields that would otherwise be lost. If the number of\n    folded differences exceeds a predetermined value, the DPU left\n    shifts the differencing scheme by the least significant bit doubling\n    the dynamic range. There is a maximum of two left shifts permitted.\n    The data return sample rate is linked to the spacecraft data rate.\n    The instrument has three data rate allocations. Both the rate of\n    primary (compressed) samples and secondary (full-word) samples\n    varies with the data rate.\n \n       Data Rate          Primary Values         Secondary Values\n       (bits/sec)         (samples/sec)            (samples/sec)\n       -----------------------------------------------------------\n         324                   8                       1/6\n         648                  16                       1/3\n        1296                  32                       2/3in\n \n    ===================================================================","is_prime":true,"tools":[]},{"tags":["Radio Transceiver"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:rss.mgs","display_name":"MGS Radio Science Subsystem","display_description":"The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Radio Science investigations\n      utilized instrumentation with elements on the spacecraft and\n      at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).

Thus, the instrument has extensive,\n    applicable flight heritage.  The alpha and proton spectrometer\n    portions were provided by the Max Planck Institute, Mainz\n    Germany.  The X-Ray spectrometer portion was provided by the\n    University of Chicago.  Integration of the instrument portions\n    was the responsibility of the Principal Investigator.\n \n    This elemental analysis instrument consists of nine curium-244\n    alpha-particle sources and three detectors for each of three\n    types of particles: backscattered alpha particles, protons, and\n    X-rays.  The APX spectrometer was placed against rocks and soils\n    on Mars to determine the abundances of all elements except\n    hydrogen, with a lower detection limit of about 0.1 weight\n    percent.  The analytical process is based on three interactions\n    of alpha particles with matter: elastic scattering of alpha\n    particles by nuclei, alpha-proton nuclear reactions with certain\n    light elements, and excitation of the atomic structure of atoms\n    by alpha particles leading to the emission of characteristic\n    X-rays.  The approach used is to expose material to a radioactive\n    source that produces alpha particles with a known energy, and to\n    acquire energy spectra of the alpha particles, protons and X-rays\n    returned from the sample.\n \n    The basis of the alpha mode of the instrument is the dependence\n    of the energy spectrum of alpha particles scattered from a\n    surface on the composition of the surface material.  The method\n    has the best resolving power for the lighter elements (carbon and\n    oxygen).  A least-squares analysis of a complex spectrum from an\n    unknown sample in terms of a library of known, pure element\n    spectra determines the elements and their abundance in the\n    sample.  A characteristic of the alpha technique is that, due to\n    variations in scattering intensity with atomic number, there is a\n    minimum in the scattering probability for elements with atomic\n    numbers between 9 and 14.  This includes the important elements\n    Na, Mg, and Al, so the alpha mode alone is insufficient for these\n    elements.  On the other hand, these elements produce protons when\n    bombarded with alpha particles.  The proton spectra for alpha\n    particles interacting with elements with atomic numbers from 9 to\n    14 are very characteristic of the individual elements, reflecting\n    the resonance nature of the nuclear interactions involved.  The\n    proton mode allows their detection and measurement.  The alpha\n    particles from the radiation sources are also an efficient source\n    for production of characteristic X-rays.  The addition of a third\n    detector for X-rays therefore results in a significant extension\n    of the accuracy and sensitivity of the instrument, particularly\n    for the heavier, less abundant elements.  In the X-ray technique,\n    characteristic X-rays are emitted when the low electron orbit\n    vacancies (in the K- and L-shells) produced by bombardment of\n    atoms by alpha particles are filled by electrons from higher\n    orbits.\n \n    The APXS electronics are mounted in the rover warm electronics\n    box in a temperature-controlled environment.  Cables leaving the\n    electronics box connect the APXS electronics to the APXS sensor\n    head, which contains the radioactive sources and particle\n    detectors.  The instrument sensor head is held by a robotic arm\n    (deployment mechanism) attached to the back of the rover.  The\n    deployment mechanism, which places the APXS in contact with rock\n    and soil surfaces, interfaces the APXS with the microrover.  For\n    the APXS to conduct a high quality measurement of a rock or soil\n    sample, it must be placed with its front aperture ring in contact\n    with the sample surface and the axis of the sensor head must be\n    within 20 degrees of normal to the surface.  The linkage is\n    designed to allow the APXS to be placed at a variety of\n    elevations above nominal ground level and at a variety of\n    rotational orientations.  The mounting of the APXS to the\n    deployment mechanism permits about 20 degrees of compliance\n    motion as the APXS is placed in contact with the sample.  Three\n    contact sensors on the deployment mechanism bumper ring indicate\n    to the rover that the positioning is complete, thereby\n    terminating the positioning motions.  The sources and detectors\n    are recessed in a cylinder 4 cm behind the bumper and the area of\n    rock or soil that is analyzed with the instrument is a circle 5\n    cm across.\n \n    Instrument Id                   : APXS\n    Instrument Host Id              : MPFR\n    PI PDS User Id                  : R.

These LN-200S IMU's\n    have space flight heritage, having been successfully flown on the\n    Clementine mission.\n \n    The accelerometers within each IMU had a dynamic range of 80g\n    (where g here represents Earth's standard surface gravitational\n    acceleration of 9.80665 meters per second per second) and a\n    resolution of 2.4 milli g's, with a noise level of 1.6 milli g's\n    when sampled at 400 Hz (the nominal instrument sampling rate).\n    The spacecraft could not handle 400 Hz sampling, so the IMU data\n    were summed over 50 measurements, resulting in an 8 Hz sampling\n    by the spacecraft.  This summing has the effect of reducing the\n    the effective noise to 300 micro g's, with an effective\n    resolution of 50 micro g's.  These instrument attributes are\n    clearly discussed in [CRISPETAL2003].\n \n    Atmospheric entry occurred at a nominal height of 128 km above\n    the Mars surface at a nominal atmospheric relative velocity of\n    5400 m/s.  The frictional drag of the atmosphere upon the entry\n    vehicle results in a reduction in the speed of the entry vehicle.\n    This deceleration is measured by the accelerometers within the\n    IMU, while the orientation of the entry vehicle is provided by\n    the gyroscope measurements.\n \n    The FOGs also provided relative orientation information for both\n    the backshell and the lander after parachute deployment, which\n    occurred approximately 240 seconds after entry at an altitude\n    approximately 8.5 kilometers above the surface.  The lander\n    separated from the backshell and descended on a tether\n    approximately 30 seconds after parachute deployment.  Subsequent\n    simultaneous backshell and lander (rover) IMU measurements in\n    this tethered condition allow for the 'swing' of the lander on\n    the tether to be determined.  This enabled removal of this motion\n    from the accelerometer measurements, permitting a determination\n    of the net motion of the lander toward the surface.  This allows\n    for atmospheric profile reconstruction while the lander is still\n    attached to the parachute.  These measurements (as well as the\n    descent imaging) also served as part of the guidance for the\n    horizontal motion reduction system which was included to minimize\n    lander horizontal motion upon initial impact with the surface.\n    The bridle connecting the lander to the backshell was severed\n    approximately three seconds prior to surface impact.  The\n    backshell IMU measurements ceased upon the severing of this\n    connection.","is_prime":true,"tools":[]},{"tags":["Abrasion Tool"],"logical_identifier":"urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:rat.mer1","display_name":"MER-Opportunity Rock Abrasion Tool","display_description":"The Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) is an integral part of the Athena\n    Science payload; it was produced to act as the payload's geologic\n    hammer and more.

Only one IMU was used during descent, entry and landing\n    (EDL). The other IMU was a backup device that was not turned on. The\n    Phoenix IMU is quasi-standard commercial product, sometimes called a\n    Miniature IMU, or MIMU [GARAVELLIETAL1995]. This particular device\n    was manufactured by Honeywell (Clearwater, FL) with model number\n    YG9666BC. The IMU used three Allied Signal QFLEX accelerometers for\n    linear acceleration measurement and three Honeywell GG1320 RLG\n    ring-laser gyros for angular rotation measurement. However, the IMU\n    was configured internally so that the linear accelerations were\n    integrated and output as linear velocity changes while the gyro\n    measurements were output as angle changes in a given sample time. No\n    input from scientists was possible concerning the device selection\n    and location within the lander, which was done by spacecraft\n    engineers for the cancelled NASA Mars 2001 Lander prior to the\n    initiation of the Phoenix project. The Phoenix lander was based on\n    the Mars 2001 Lander design. Consequently, the IMU used during EDL of\n    the Phoenix spacecraft was neither located at the entry vehicle\n    center of mass nor the spin axis, which otherwise would have been\n    desirable to optimize noise minimization for scientific purposes.\n \n    The instrument attributes for the PHX IMU are discussed in\n    [TAYLORETAL2008]. At a rate of 200 Hz, the IMU output the accumulated\n    linear velocity change (the time integral of acceleration) in three\n    Cartesian axes and accumulated angle change (the time integral of\n    angular rate) about three Cartesian axes. Data was saved onboard PHX\n    at the device output rate of 200 Hz and was not down-sampled.\n \n    The IMU had a mass of 3.52 kg and approximately 4051 cc volume.  Each\n    accelerometer within the IMU had a full-scale range of 36.8g (where g\n    represents Earth's standard surface gravitational acceleration of\n    9.80665 meters per second per second). The accelerometer and gyro\n    signals were electronically integrated inside the IMU to produce an\n    output of accumulated delta-v (linear velocity change) and delta-q\n    (angular velocity change) at 200 Hz.  The accelerometers had two\n    stages of digitization that resulted in pulses and then counts. The\n    final raw digital output from the IMU accelerometers was in counts,\n    in velocity units, where 1 output count = 0.0753 mm/sec.  But the\n    final output moved up and down in pulses, which are leaps of many\n    counts, with each pulse equivalent to 2.7 mm/sec. Thus, the amplitude\n    of one pulse was equivalent to 2.7/0.0753 = 35.86 counts, on\n    average. Added to this was noise in the system, which was on the\n    order of 1 count, so that jumps in the raw output were typically 36\n    or 37 counts. This determined the digital resolution of the raw 200\n    Hz data to be a delta-v of 2.7 mm/sec and typical noise level of\n    0.0753 mm/sec.\n \n    Individual gyros measure the angular rotation about one axis. Each\n    raw IMU gyro output is a 16 bit signed integer (i.e., from -32767 to\n    +32767) with the least significant bit (LSB) equivalent to 1\n    micro-radian. Because the data was generated at 200 Hz or every 5\n    millisecs, a full-scale value of 32768 would correspond to 375\n    deg/sec. (32,768 * 1 microradian /0.005 sec = 0.032768/0.005\n    radian/sec = 6.5536 rad/sec = 375 deg/sec). The smallest motion in a\n    200 Hz interval is one count, which corresponds to 0.01144 deg/sec (1\n    * 1 microradian /0.005 sec = 200 micro-rad/sec = 0.01144 deg/sec).\n    Smaller angular motions can be measured over longer time periods by\n    integration of the raw data.

This affects local and global meteorological patterns which in\n    turn determine the lifting of dust from the surface and long range\n    transport [LEOVY2001; NEWMAN2002]. There is also a climate interaction\n    with the distribution of water ice above and below the surface of Mars\n    [BOYNTON2002, PATHAK2008]. This involves transport of water through the\n    atmosphere and previous lidar measurements from orbit have indicated that\n    clouds could have a substantial role [NEUMANN2003].\n \n    The lidar on the Phoenix mission will record the height profile of laser\n    backscatter from the dust and cloud layers that drift past the landing\n    site with a view that is continuous in time. The attenuation of the lidar\n    signal can be used to derive the optical extinction coefficient and this\n    is related to atmospheric properties. For example, the extinction of solar\n    radiation due to dust has a first order effect on heating of the surface\n    of Mars. The measured optical extinction can also be related to the amount\n    of scattering material. For example, for a thin cloud the extinction\n    coefficient measured by a lidar can be used to derive the ice water\n    content within the cloud [HEYMSFIELD2005]. Such a measurement will be of\n    vital importance to the mission goal to investigate water on Mars. The\n    combination of the lidar and passive remote sensing with in situ sampling\n    will provide a view of the interacting processes that determine the local\n    weather at the surface and also the role of the atmosphere in the water\n    cycle on Mars.\n \n    A basic atmospheric lidar (light detection and ranging) emits pulses of\n    laser light into the atmosphere then detects and records the backscattered\n    light as a function of time [MEASURES1984].

This configuration was\n    chosen for its robustness and technological maturity as much as for its\n    suitable lidar performance. The pump diode array emits at a wavelength of\n    808 nm and is used to provide the energy to the Nd:YAG crystal within the\n    laser cavity. Lasing is inhibited within the cavity through the use of a\n    saturable absorber. The photon density within the oscillator cavity builds\n    to a level where the saturable absorber bleaches and the energy within the\n    cavity is dumped as a laser pulse over a very short time (a passive\n    Q-switch). For this laser the output light pulse has a length of\n    approximately 10 ns and an energy of 0.7 mJ.\n \n    After the laser cavity emits its light pulse, part of the optical energy\n    is converted from a wavelength of 1064 nm to 532 nm by second harmonic\n    generation in a Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) crystal. The laser\n    output is then expanded by a factor of 10 in order to reduce the\n    divergence to 0.5 mrad. A small fraction of the outgoing laser pulse is\n    'picked off' and separated into the two wavelength components in order to\n    measure the relative amplitude of each wavelength with photodiodes. The\n    signal from the photodiode detecting the 1064 nm pulse is used to trigger\n    the data acquisition electronics, providing a zero-time reference, and\n    also to shut off the pumping diodes.\n \n    The atmospheric backscatter signals are collected by an afocal reflective\n    telescope and split into the two relevant wavelengths using dichroic\n    mirrors. The 1064 nm backscatter is detected by an Avalanche Photo-Diode\n    (APD), and recorded using 14-bit analog to digital conversion (ADC). The\n    532 nm backscatter is detected by a Photomultiplier (PMT) and the signal\n    is recorded using both ADC and photon counting.

It is\n    designed to acquire images of particulate Martian material (soil, dust) at a\n    spatial resolution of 4 microns/px.

The SWTS is shared by the OM and the Atomic Force\n    Microscope (AFM). It contains a total of 69 substrates: 10 sets of 6\n    substrates plus 9 substrates holding OM and AFM calibration targets. Each\n    set of 6 substrates consists of a weak and a strong magnet, 2 (identical)\n    microbuckets (empty holes, 2 mm deep, 3 mm in diameter) for bulk sampling, a\n    nanobucket (silicon textured substrate with micron-sized pits and pillar\n    features for fixing particles and retaining the original size distribution\n    of the acquired sample) and a sticky silicone substrate.

They were all calibrated with respect to geometric\n    flat field response, detector dark current, camera absolute\n    responsivity, detector noise performance, and detector gain.\n \n \n  Detectors\n  =========\n \n    Each Hazcam uses a 1024 x 2048 pixel CCD with 12 micron-square\n    pixels and a 100% optical fill factor. The CCDs operate in frame-\n    transfer mode, dividing the detector into two regions. One of the\n    regions is a 1204 x 1204 pixel photosensitive imaging region where\n    the image is recorded. The other region is a 1204 x 1204 shielded\n    storage region where the recorded image is shifted and stored during\n    detector readout. It takes 5.1 msec to transfer data from the\n    imaging region to the storage region, and 5.4 seconds for readout of\n    data from the storage region. Each CCD includes 32 non-imaging\n    pixels in the serial readout registers, which allow the monitoring\n    of the CCD electronics offset and detector noise performance. The\n    Hazcam CCD pixels have full well capacities of approximately 170,000\n    electrons and are digitized at 12 bits/ pixel. The RMS read noise\n    at cold temperatures (-55 degrees C) is approximately 20 electrons,\n    and the detector system has gain values of approximately 50 e-/DN,\n    which results in a system with approximately 0.5 DN of RMS read\n    noise.\n \n    The absolute quantum efficiency (QE) of the CCDs has been measured\n    between 400 and 1000 nm at four operating temperatures ranging from\n    218 K and 278 K. The QE of the MSL CCDs is typical of a silicon CCD\n    detector, with sensitivity peaking at 700 nm with a QE value of\n    approximately 43%. The SNR of the detector system is essentially\n    Poisson-limited because of its low readout noise and small dark\n    current rates in the Martian operating envirionments.\n \n \n  Electronics\n  ===========\n \n    The Hazcam CCDs use a 'clocked antiblooming' readout technique,\n    instead of having anti-blooming circuitry. The proper choice of\n    autoexposure parameters prevent the blooming effect.\n \n    The Hazcams also have the capability for onboard image processing.\n    The Hazcams can do pixel summation in which they sum the rows and\n    columns of an image, returning the results in a one-dimensional\n    array of 32-bit integers whose length is the image height. These\n    are very useful when the spatial content of an image has relatively\n    low scene entropy and the emphasis is on the radiometry. The flight\n    software (FSW) can also calculate and return the histogram of an\n    image, which can be useful for atmospheric observations. Hazcam\n    images can be spatially downsampled to a user-specified image size\n    using one of a few techniques; nearest neighbor computation of the\n    mean, computation of the mean with outlier rejection, and median\n    averaging. The FSW also allows the option to downlink a subframed\n    region of an image so full resolution can be downlinked at a lower\n    data volume. The FSW is also capable of lossy and lossless\n    compression of MER images. The rovers will use a ICER wavelet image\n    compressor for the lossy and lossless compression.\n \n \n  Filters\n  =======\n \n    The Hazcams use a combination of three filters (Schott OG590,\n    KG5, and ND1.3) to create a red bandpass filter centered at\n    650 nm and a FWHM of approximately 140 nm.\n \n \n  Optics\n  ======\n \n    The Hazcams have f/15 cameras with a 5.58 nm focal length. The\n    Hazcam optics are f-theta fisheye lenses with 124 degree x 124\n    degree horizontal/ vertical field of view and a 180 degree diagonal\n    field of view. They have an angular resolution at the center of the\n    picture of 2.1 milliradians/pixel. The nominal exposure time for a\n    noontime image on Mars is approximately .25 seconds. This time is 50\n    times the frame transfer time of 5.1 ms. This ensures that the image\n    signal is significantly than the image smear acquired during the\n    frame transfer. The spectral range of the Hazcams is 600-800 nm.\n \n \n  Covers\n  ======\n \n    Each Hazcam pair has a cover assembly with Lexan windows to protect\n    the cameras from debris during descent and landing.

The MSL APXS takes advantage of a combination of\n    the terrestrial standard methods Particle-Induced X-ray Emission\n    (PIXE) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) to determine elemental chemistry.\n    It uses curium-244 sources for X-ray spectroscopy to determine the\n    abundance of major elements down to trace elements from sodium to\n    bromine and beyond.\n \n    The instrument consists of a main electronics unit in the rover's\n    body and a sensor head mounted on the robotic arm. Measurements\n    are taken by deploying the sensor head towards a desired sample,\n    placing the sensor head in contact or hovering typically less than\n    2 cm away, and measuring the emitted X-ray spectrum for 15 minutes\n    to 3 hours without the need of further interaction by the rover.\n    At the end of the measurement, the rover retrieves the science\n    data of 32 kilobytes, containing up to 13 consecutively taken\n    spectra and engineering data. The internal APXS software splits\n    the total measurement into equal time slots with an adjustable\n    cycle time parameter. This allows us to check for repeatability\n    and to select spectra with sufficient spectral quality.\n \n    The MSL APXS can activate an internal Peltier cooler for the X-ray\n    detector chip. This results in a sufficient spectral resolution\n    (FWHM) of below 200 eV at 6.4 keV below ~ -5 deg C and best FWHM of <\n    150 eV below ~ -15 deg C environmental temperature. Compared to the\n    APXS on MER, where the best FWHM was reached at temperatures below\n    ~ -45 deg C, this allows a significantly larger operational time\n    window for APXS analysis.\n \n    The MSL APXS has approximately 3 times the sensitivity for low Z\n    (atomic number) elements and approximately 6 times for higher Z\n    elements than the MER APXS. A full analysis with detection limits\n    of 100 ppm for Ni and ~ 20 ppm for Br now requires 3 hours, while\n    quick look analysis for major and minor elements at ~ 0.5%\n    abundance, such as Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe, or S, can be done in 10\n    minutes or less.\n \n    On MER, the elements detected by the APXS in rock and soil samples\n    are typically Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni,\n    Zn, and Br [RIEDERETAL2004] [GELLERTETAL2006].\n    Elevated levels of Ge, Ga, Pb, and Rb were found in some of the\n    MER samples [CLARKETAL2007].\n \n    The sampled area is about 1.7 cm in diameter when the instrument\n    is in contact with the sample. A standoff results in gradually\n    lower intensity and an increased diameter of the measured spot.\n    Low Z element X-rays stem from the topmost 5 microns of the\n    sample, higher Z elements like Fe are detected from the upper ~50\n    microns. Sample preparation is not needed; the APXS results\n    average the composition over the sampled area and the oxide\n    abundances measured are renormalized to 100%.

In addition, due to the 15-bit\nlimitation of the digital altitude word, any radar data above 32767 m are\naffected by a register overflow. In addition to these digital data errors,\nthe radar has been found to be sensitive to temperature changes and is\naffected by systematic errors that depend on the probe altitude.

RASU is\ntelemetered at 4 Hz with a 0.47 mg accuracy. Due to the loss of\nchain A (LEBRETONETAL2005), only one of the raw RASU\ndatasets is available on-ground. Nevertheless, analysis of the\nprocessed DDB for both chains (available from the instruments\ninternal telemetry), indicates that both sensors were measuring\nsimilar values and functioning nominally.\n \nUsage: RASU raw telemetry is archived as HK_CDMS_RASU_D8005A.TAB.\n \n2) AGC (raw telemetry archived as HK_CDMS_RASU_D8005A.TAB) - Automatic\nGain Control: this telemetry parameter is the control word of the\nsecond coherent AGC loop in the digital part of the receiver. Reported\nat 8Hz, it is proportional to the signal power received on board\nCassini. The AGC has been flight-calibrated, being the conversion to\nsignal-to-noise ratio Es/N0 based on the Probe Relay Test analysis.\n \nUsage: AGC raw telemetry is obtained from the archived parameters\n \nAGC_raw (digital number) = 256 * HK_PDRS_PSAB_R60047.TAB +\nHK_PDRS_PSAB_R60037.TAB.\n \nThese raw data are calibrated based on the following interpolation\n(from PRT#4, day4 flight test data):\n \nAGC raw: 612.9438 607.1000 599.8319 590.6696 580.7143 568.5962 554.3304\n536.7500 517.0385 475.5833 448.0714 418.8846 388.2768 357.2596 325.9554\n295.4000 266.7857 240.8214 215.3393 193.3482 173.7589 155.5893 140.6538\nAGC calibrated: -4.6862 -3.6862 -2.6862 -1.6862 -0.6862 0.3138 1.3138\n2.3138 3.3138 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18\n \nTHE SPIN RATE RECONSTRUCTION\n \n*The spin sign: the reversal anomaly\n \nAs explained in detail in (Perez-Ayucar et al, 2005) the analysis of the\nradio link patterns confirmed an unexpected spin reversal in the mission:\nthe AGC patterns before and after the inversion correlate well only if one\nis time-reversed. As a result, the Huygens in-flight spin direction has\nbeen estimated as counter-clockwise (CCW) (seen in the velocity direction;\nspin value >0) for the early part of the descent (consistent with the spin\nimparted at separation from Cassini), and clockwise (CW) for the whole\nstabilizer chute phase (spin value <0). This is non-compliant with the\nProbe specification.\n \n*The absolute azimuth reconstruction\n \nThe AGC analysis remarkably provides absolute azimuth as a function of\ntime, with respect to a known point in the sky, Cassini.\n \nThe estimation of the azimuth can be performed by integrating the spin\nrate, in turn obtained from the radial acceleration (RASU). However,\nthis method is not accurate enough as it relies on an integration and\ntherefore it is subject to biases and to the assumption of an initial\nabsolute reference. Another finer method, the AGC manual counting,\nremarkably provides absolute azimuth as a function of time, with\nrespect to a known point in the sky, Cassini.\n \nThe Probe Transmitting Antennas (PTA) are not ideal but present an\nazimuthal asymmetry (Clausen et al., 2002). As Huygens spun down to the\nsurface, the received power at Cassini showed periodic variations every\nrotation. The PTA gain pattern was measured before launch in a\nrepresentative mock-up, so by comparison one can estimate the absolute\nOrbiter azimuth in a Probe body-fixed frame. It is assumed that the\nProbe is vertical and spins ideally, so that the elevation is\nconsidered fixed (at least for several spin periods) and equal to the\nPAA. The elevation slowly evolves with time, and is also taken into\naccount.\n \nAfter obtaining an absolute azimuth profile in the Probe fixed\nreference frame, a geometric conversion is applied to express it on\nTitan's local frame.\n \nRegarding the inherent error in the identification of the peaks, the\nmain contributors are: 1) the tested Antenna Gain Pattern data is\nlimited to a 2 deg step (for both azimuth & elevation). This influences\nboth the selection of the PAA and the matching of the peak in azimuth;\n2) the AGC sampling rate (8Hz) implies that as the period of the signal\ndecreases, fewer points are available and therefore the angular\nresolution decreases; 3) the pixel size when visually identifying the\npeaks on a screen. All those contributions are independent; hence a\nroot-of-squares estimator has been computed. Although dependent on\ntime, its value never exceeds +/- 5 deg.\n \nRegarding the error in the frame conversion, an attitude disturbance in\ntip - tilt induces an azimuth error when converting from the PTA\n(Huygens body fixed) reference frame to the Titan's local surface\nframe. A complex estimation was carried out in (Sarlette, 2005b).\n \n The error estimation is:\n \n-Max values up to ~30deg @ start of mission\n-Less than 3deg @ touchdown\n \n* The spin actual rate reconstruction\n \nThe most accurate way of obtaining the spin rate is by the derivative\nof the absolute azimuth obtained as described from AGC. Nevertheless,\nthe azimuth values from the manual counting method are not optimum at:\n \n- the spin peak, where the rotation (~10 rpm) is fast wrt the\nsampling rate of 8Hz. Fewer samples per period are hence available. In\naddition the rather strong attitude disturbances in this interval\n(rough early descent with the stabilizer parachute) are also reflected\nin the AGC.\n \n- the spin reversal: as the Probe stopped spinning, the repetition\npattern was not present, and the peak identification uncertain.\nSpectrogram (AGC-FFT method) is a coarser but useful method to fill in\nthese gaps. The dynamic FFT does not provide absolute azimuth, only a\nheavily-filtered spin rate, which in turn can be time-integrated to\nfind azimuth values. Unfortunately, the frequency resolution achieved\nby an FFT analysis for an 8Hz signal is directly proportional to the\nduration of its periodic cycles. During a large part of the descent and\nclose to the surface the rotation was slow (less than 3 rpm) and\ntherefore the spin resolution is coarse. The method is only used around\nthe spin peak.\n \nIn the spin inversion, a more appropriate method relies on the\noccurrence of RASU values. RASU cannot be used directly to derive the\nspin rate since only positive values are transmitted in the telemetry\n(design feature). The high sensitivity of the sensor is such that\nattitude disturbances other than the centrifugal spin are clearly\nrecorded, as wobbling, pendulum motion, etc... Assuming that the\ndisturbance implies an offset in the measured acceleration, equally\ndistributed around its mean value, the smoothed median is a good\nindicator of the instantaneous radial acceleration. Again, the method\ndoes not provide absolute azimuth, only a filtered spin rate, which in\nturn can be time-integrated to obtain azimuth values. The error in this\nmethod is large for low spin rates. The spin rate is computed as a\nsquare root of the raw acceleration, so the fixed quantization step\n(~0.47mg) in the RASU telemetries implies a variable step when\nexpressed in rpm, increasing as the spin rate decreases. Many of the\nnear surface measurements are therefore in the level of the\nquantization step, and the retrieval of the spin rate is not as\nreliable as in the AGC method. Note that RASU data are cut at 0g.\n \nTherefore, the consolidated spin rate of the Probe has been\nreconstructed using these combined methods:\n \nTime period on 14Jan2005           Values used
